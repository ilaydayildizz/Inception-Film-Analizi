XQPy88-E2zo,@MsLizzybusy,"The ending of Inception is famously ambiguous: Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns home and spins his totem (a spinning top) to check if he's in reality, but walks away to hug his children before seeing if it falls, cutting to black. Director Christopher Nolan intended this ambiguity, emphasizing that Cobb's emotional resolution and reunion with his kids matter more than objective reality, though clues like the wobbling top and different children's clothes suggest he is likely awake, as he finally stops caring about the totem.",2026-01-15T09:07:40Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@yeyo1990,"There was nothing ambiguous about it. Nolan's genius had the audience believing that the token was the top, when in reality it was the dream machine itself. In every scene where they wake up from the dream within the dream sequence they are hooked up to the  dream machine, this was the only scene where Cobb woke up from the dream within the dream and Nolan didn't show him being hooked up, that's because Cobb is in a coma on the plane and this is his reality. Nolan fooled everyone but a select few. That little wiggle with the top at the end was Nolan's diversion from the real token which was the dream machine.",2026-01-11T00:56:03Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@maskedskill,"Dom Cobb is in reality at the end.

Here’s why:

The Totem Isn’t Truly His

The spinning top actually belonged to Mal, his wife — it was her totem.

Cobb’s real totem was never explicitly shown (some fans theorize it’s his wedding ring, which he wears only in dreams).

In the final scene, he’s not wearing the ring, which suggests he’s awake.

The Top’s Wobble

The top doesn’t spin perfectly smoothly — it wobbles slightly, which it never does in dream sequences.

Nolan cuts before it falls, but the wobble hints that gravity is taking effect — implying reality.

Cobb’s State of Mind

Throughout the film, Cobb’s emotional barrier is his guilt over Mal.

By the end, he’s accepted her death and let go of the guilt — symbolically freeing himself to live in reality again.

The “test” of the totem no longer matters to him; his focus shifts to his children.

Christopher Nolan’s Subtle Hint

Nolan has said in interviews that the important thing isn’t whether it’s real or not — it’s that Cobb doesn’t care anymore.

However, in production notes and crew interviews, there are subtle confirmations (like the sound design team mentioning the top’s “wobble cue”) suggesting it’s reality.",2025-10-31T13:24:38Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@RayJacks-x7d,"So I gotta tell you all.  I became slightly obsessed with this concept before I ever saw the movie, before the movie ever came out.  This thought came into my head that I could not get rid of... It's slightly different but not much.  

It's that what if when we get to the end of our lives with all the adventure, chaos, beauty and mostly difficulty and we're simply sitting in a chair and had our eyes closed like waking up from anesthesia.  At the time I thought what if it wasn't even heaven you were waiting for but perhaps the unplug from a sort of dip into a ridiculous virtual world that took immense strength.  You look around the room slowly realizing what happened.  All your drama and worry in life now met with the realization that it was just simply like a dream.  Like having been plugged into a video game, but what you must sharpen your iron will to and resilience among other various traits to complete.  An adventure with hardship, tragedy and chaos where you play the individual.  A feet to get through where you feared death the whole time.  After a seemingly hundred years that went by only to wake up with people around you in a sort of beautiful trance just like it was a dream with all the trimmings of a ridiculously intense life but it really happened in a second.  The people around you in the chairs look at you with wonder and sort of victory as you wake up and they call you by your name and say, ""welcome, you did it.""  I couldn't get this thought out of my head.  For a while it stuck in me like a splinter.   As I would drive to stoplights for a bit I would reflect on it.  It was too powerful of thought to release.  Then inception came out, and it was just like the scene your seeing here.",2025-10-10T08:14:19Z

Everyone was SOOO freaking emotionally invested into the movie at that point - especially after seeing everything culminate in that massive collective sigh of relief when they woke up on the plane…. that last scene just drew so many emotions from people. Nervous laughs, people yelling “noo!” an occasional “omg”… “you can’t do that!” 😂

I try to see all of Nolan’s movies on opening weekends, preferably in IMAX, and one thing they all have in common is the subdued yet intense conversation that all of his movies elicit from viewers leaving the theaters. I think that’s the true mark of a good writer / director.",2025-09-02T00:54:06Z

Hate how true this seems to be becoming a reality for me. Soon to turn 40 and I already have so much of that in my life. Losing both my parents within a short time of each other,  all our pets, who were part of my young teenage life into adult hood. All the final goodbyes still feel surreal. As if I'm just waiting to wake up from a bad dream. How in an instant, everything I've known and loved, becomes a memory. In 5 years, I lost them all, and now life just feels empty.

The one that won the world record was a Korean wooden top, and it spun for seven hours. The type of tops that he spins in this movie might spin for a few minutes, but I couldn't get a definite answer or even an estimate as to how long. It is probably something less than seven hours, and probably less than an hour. But I don't know. The movie leaves the ending ambiguous, so we need an alternate ending where you just sit there with the camera staring at the spinning top, and nothing else, for, like, two hours, just so we can be sure.",2025-06-26T22:13:22Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@pjfromnyc,"What was the deeper meaning behind the ending scene in the airport behind the 2010 film Inception 

The ending airport scene in Christopher Nolan’s Inception (2010) is one of the most debated moments in modern cinema. The scene carries profound layers of meaning, leaving the audience with questions about reality, perception, and the nature of choice. Here's an analysis of its deeper meaning:


---

1. The Ambiguity of Reality

As Cobb reunites with his children in the airport and later spins his totem (the spinning top) at home, the film leaves us wondering: Is this reality, or is Cobb still in a dream?

The ambiguity mirrors the central theme of Inception: how we define and accept reality. The film suggests that our perception of reality is often subjective, shaped by what we choose to believe rather than objective truth.



---

2. Cobb’s Choice to Let Go

Throughout the film, Cobb is haunted by guilt over his wife Mal and his inability to distinguish dreams from reality. In the final scene, he doesn’t wait to see if the top stops spinning—he turns away and embraces his children.

This symbolizes Cobb’s decision to let go of his obsession with verifying reality. His focus shifts from questioning whether this is ""real"" to simply being present with his family. It suggests that what matters isn’t whether it’s a dream or reality, but what he chooses to value and experience in the moment.



---

3. The Theme of Acceptance

The ending reflects the idea of accepting the life you’ve built, regardless of uncertainties. Cobb’s journey is one of reconciliation, where he finally overcomes his inner turmoil and guilt. By choosing to be with his children without obsessing over the top, he accepts the life in front of him, whether it’s real or not.

This resonates with the broader human experience of grappling with uncertainty and finding meaning in our choices, even when we don’t have all the answers.



---

4. The Role of Faith Over Proof

The spinning top represents Cobb’s reliance on external validation to distinguish reality from dreams. When he walks away from it, it signifies a shift from needing proof to having faith in his experience.

This reflects the philosophical idea that life’s meaning often isn’t in what can be proven but in what we choose to believe. Cobb’s faith in his love for his children and his newfound peace outweighs the need to confirm the nature of his reality.



---

5. Reality vs. Dreams: Does It Matter?

Nolan intentionally leaves the ending open to interpretation to highlight that the distinction between dreams and reality might not be as important as we think. What matters is how we engage with the world we find ourselves in.

For Cobb, whether he’s dreaming or awake becomes irrelevant—what’s important is that he’s free from guilt and can finally reconnect with his children.



---

6. The Audience’s Role

The unresolved spinning top also draws the audience into the philosophical dilemma. Nolan intentionally makes us question the nature of the story we just experienced:

Was it all a dream?

Does reality matter, or is it the emotions and meaning we derive that give it value?


This blurring of boundaries between fiction and reality forces viewers to confront their own assumptions about what is ""real.""



---

Conclusion

The deeper meaning behind the ending scene in Inception lies in its exploration of acceptance, faith, and the subjective nature of reality. Cobb’s journey teaches us that what truly matters isn’t whether life adheres to an objective standard of truth but whether we find peace, meaning, and love in the life we choose to live.

The spinning top’s fate is left uncertain because the ultimate question isn’t whether it falls—it’s whether Cobb has found his freedom.",2025-01-27T17:25:10Z

1. Unlike a top that should spin forever, this one has a jerk in it's spin at the end that one would associate with a top that is going to stop. Plus, the sound at the end confirms that jerk in its motion.
2. In the previous versions of this scene where it's not reality, irrespective of whether he chose to look away or not, there seemed to have been a design to prevent him from running and meeting the kids. Like a memory that has broken, which breaks when the kids turn around. So, the dream state not only had his resistance, but external resistance as well - especially from the fact that he had no further memory beyond being taken away before the kids turned around. This was different, and there wasn't any such resistance. So, welcome back home Mr. Cobb!",2024-11-16T14:29:52Z

I remember seeing this in the movie theater for the first time, and I was so immersed in the story, and all of the sequences that happened before this scene, and when Cobb wakes up on the plane... it was the exact same feeling I had of waking up after experiencing a very realistic dream and having to take a moment to realize my surroundings. I had completely forgotten where the ""reality"" of the story began, and when this scene happens, it was literally like awakening from a dream.  It's hard to explain, but it's the only film that has ever made me feel like I was actually in the film itself, and experiencing what the characters are experiencing.",2024-09-27T15:08:06Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@drake128,"If Fischer had been trained by an extractor making his mind “militarised” then may he not suspect the strange dreams he just had?
He is aware of extraction , how it works and is aware how to wake himself up. He might be familiar with the concept of inception ,even if not then at least the room he wakes up in has all the people he just dreamt about which may raise red flags of an attempted extraction attempt ( if he wasn’t aware of the concept of inception ).
I know he gives Cobb a glance at the baggage collection like he half remembers the dream but wouldn’t this make him slightly curious ?
Or he just thought that was one wild dream and broke up his fathers legacy .

He is probably in in a coma or an Alzheimer’s patient suffering until he created this ending. But the whole movie is a dream. Remember NO one is to touch the totem or else you will never know. Well he was found on a beach they searched his pockets and found his totem while he was unconscious. So from the very beginning the very thing he tried to avoid already happened. It was touched.

In the beginning she asked why can't we see the kids' faces, and in the end they showed their faces to Cobb. Therefore it was real.

The spinning top was actually his wife's and not his. At the last scene during the immigration you can clearly see that he wasn't wearing his ring which shows it was reality.,2024-01-31T15:11:23Z

Once reality is broken, there is no way to put back the pieces, no trust will remain and all sanity will be lost.

XQPy88-E2zo,@postman77,This may seem random but I grew up in the church and thought that was the whole religion just going to church every Sunday and eventually stopped going and started to do my own thing.  I wanted to find the purpose of life because I knew everything we worked for would pass away. Later on I had a tug on my heart to open up the Bible and saw the Jesus people talked about was completely different from what was in the Bible.  I started to draw closer to the higher power and had a supernatural encounter with him and I felt his love and peace and was indescribable and overwhelming almost but was out of this world and everything looked brand new like it was the first time seeing it when I looked outside. His name is Jesus and I’m here to tell you it’s about a relationship not religion and he is real and did die on the cross for you willingly and thinks you as the only person and was thinking of you while dying. All we chase in this life is temporary think about your eternal life.,2023-12-01T06:55:42Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Tumbledweeb,"@postman77 Okay. So if Jesus is all-knowing, why did he say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed? It's not.",2023-12-13T07:28:29Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@postman77,@Tumbledweeb that’s assuming all seeds were the same until now but Jesus was in Israel speaking to a Jewish audience so saying a seed they never heard of would be unfamiliar but it was familiar to others and could understand,2023-12-13T16:27:54Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@Tumbledweeb,"@postman77 The smallest seed on the planet are orchid seeds, and they were as small back then as they are now. 

As for your argument that he was talking to a Jewish audience, there's a problem with your reasoning on that one. See, if Jesus was looking to get his point across by using information that they were familiar with, he could've said that the mustard seed was a very small seed, which would've worked just fine within this parable. But he didn't do that. He specifically said that the mustard seed was the smallest of all seeds, which it isn't. Not even close.

This leaves us with two possibilities:

1. Jesus is NOT all-knowing.

Or

2. Jesus IS all-knowing and was lying to them.

So, which one is it?",2023-12-13T18:05:33Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@Seikoingplastering,"Once of the finest pices of screenwriting of our time...

The question of being human itself ..is not what we believe to be real, but the inception that it could possibly all be an elaborate lie.
Our entire lives are built around  the moments we perceive & interpret of which we translate into profound emotions that stire the course of our entire lives.
But what if our dreams could be manipulated.

Did codd come home or did Saito keep him under, did they all ride the kick back up...or are they all traped 

The top keeps spinning maybe because Molly now has control of the dream..she asked cobb to stay and he refuses.

Remember in the warehouse scene..the gentleman tells codd ""these people prefer the dream but who's to say its any less real they are happy"" 
The dream is now thier reality.

XQPy88-E2zo,@willorchard,"I always interpreted this ending differently to everybody else it seems. I see a lot of comments either 1. try to like science-fiction-work-out an answer like it's a maths problem, looking at wedding rings, what the kids are saying whatever which is just obviously ridiculous, 2. loads of people saying that he realises it doesn't matter if it is a dream or not - this is the life he wants and living it like this is indistinguishable from living it any other way. I definitely prefer 2 of course - he isn't haunted by the same concern which killed his wife, but I don't think it's correct. From the moment I first saw it I always thought the ending was simple: that he doesn't need to check it's real, he already knows it is. The love for his children show him it is real more than any totem.

I think this is reminiscent of a very famous argument by GE Moore, the 'here is one hand' argument. There is a typical skeptical argument that says we cannot know if we are dreaming, so we cannot know that (for example) my children are real. What Moore said in response was, I know that my children are real, therefore I know I cannot be dreaming. (except his argument centred on knowing the existence of his hands, hence the name of the argument).",2023-10-28T18:34:58Z

Real world: 10 hours
1st layer : 10 x 20 => 200 hours => 8 days and 7 hours (about a week)
2nd layer : 10 x 20 x 20 => 4,000 hours => 166,67 days (almost six months)
3rd layer : 10 X 20 x 20 x 20 = 80,000 hours => 3,333.33 days => 111,11 months => 9,26 years (almost 10 years)

XQPy88-E2zo,@hiphoppacmotion,"I think at the ending, he ends up being in a dream. The scene of his kids with their backs to him (which is a *recurring* scene throughout the movie) is the same exact snapshot/memory of them at the last scene when he's ""freed"" to be with them. And *then* they turn around to reveal their faces? Surely if he was to see his kids again in reality, his first encounter with them once again wouldn't be them *again* picking grass/bugs/random shit on the ground, as his been the same exact scene of the the entire freaking movie--that's unrealistic. I thought for the longest time that the ending was his reality, but it really isn't--he's stuck dreaming because of the aforementioned reason I just gave. Also, in all the levels of their dreams, Cobb and Saito missed the timing of the kicks. So, they're stuck in limbo. 

And lastly, if the ""perfect life is indistinguishable from a perfect dream"" as what many people say the ending suggests, then if Cobb was happy to be in a dream in the very end of the movie, then he should have just stayed in limbo with Mal *with* their kids in that dream. So that idea makes no sense, the whole operation never needed to happen to begin with then. Cobb is in limbo at the end.",2023-09-03T07:24:11Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@marianne9221,"Yes the ending is open to intepretations, but a logical guess should favour the bad end. Think about it, Cobb has been on the run for an extended period of time based on the atmosphere of the plot and premise, not less than year at least with an educated guess. Children grow up and change really fast when they are young, so its very unlikely they would have looked exactly the same as when Cobb left them im terms of height, and even hairstyle etc. Ofc its just a guess and the timeframe could be extremely short as opposed to what im guessing it to be, but the possibility that he really succeeded is lesser than he failed. Do also consider we never got to see what Saito did with the gun. Furthermore we've seen in Mal's case that people tend to lose track of reality in limbo. Not to say Saito couldnt have realised it himself, but he did not offer the typical resistance to accepting that his reality was fake despite spending his whole life living there and accepted whatever Cobb said rather easily. So maybe that whole scene was a construct of Cobb's mind to begin with, since it went too smoothly for Cobb.",2023-07-26T10:50:06Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@naminabantu,"This movie was one of the best edited and incredibly paced movies ever. The way the tension is created in the third act until the very last scene of Saito picking up the gun, and then when Cobb wakes up, It makes the audience feel like they've themselves woke up from a bad dream. A relief, just like when we wake up from a bad dream. Zimmer's music is one of the main characters in this scene that makes this scene as good as it is.
This is movie is truly an all-timer, and one of my absolute favorites.",2023-07-20T20:48:48Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@WoozyCool,"​@midgetwars1 The top in dream world seems to almost fall but never does. Forever spinning instead. Cobb sees his kids who are in the EXACT clothes height n weight as years ago when he left. No sane odds of that happening. The kids literally other than faces turning, not a thing changed, that's sus af.
His ring disappearing isn't meaning reality, it means he finally (with help of ariadne) made peace with mal and let go of her. 
But he still chose her totem to check with reality, hence the line ""you don't know where the train will take you, but it won't matter, cuz you will be together"". He doesn't look at totem, doesn't know if the train took him to reality or still stuck in dream world, but wherever he sees his kids' faces finally is fine by him.
His guilt of leaving the kids, is now lifted, cuz of successfully finishing the job that rewards him his life with kids back,
Hence his mind simply ALLOWS him to remember his kids faces being seen by him, from the past. Which he wasn't able to see until his guilt was cleared.
Meaning he did see the kids faces, just had been a blocked memory, even for his dreams being unable to access.

In the dream once, mal tries to tell him how he can indeed see his kids and they're right there, as she was calling out to the kids, but cobb sees them do the usual thing, getting up and running without showing their faces to cobb,  he tells mal to ""just stop"".
meaning she was right, she meant he knows what their faces looked like in that exact moment in those exact clothes, he won't let himself past the guilt of leaving them and won't let himself see, the dream world mal knew that and cobb hated how she toyed with him with that.

which is why ring doesn't mean it's reality now or that the kids faces mean reality either.

XQPy88-E2zo,@JB-xl2jc,"Interstellar's ""Docking"" scene is one of my favorite in all of cinema and is one of a handful of scenes that I would change genuinely nothing about. The ending scene here is another one that I'd change nothing about. The soundtrack is absolutely INTEGRAL to the success of both. 

But they can't be directly compared, at least in my opinion. The scene in Interstellar is about the triumph of mankind against adversity (""It's not possible..."" ""No... it's necessary."") and is bombastic and gets you incredibly fired up. This scene in Inception is about the end of a chapter of life, the feeling that you and those around you have been through so much, the feeling of awakening from a dream that feels as though it stretched on forever- and yet, just as that chapter closes, a new chapter opens: a homecoming, a return to loved ones and family members.

It doesn’t guarantee anything because regardless of what NOLAN says he himself doesn’t know if it stops or not 

What if his real reality started from whenever he has the spinning top


Hear my out 

Let’s say initially he thought he’s capable of realizing what reality is and is not so he never needed a tottem
But after he got his wife’s tottem he took it as a reality 
And then started living from there *as the real reality which is not * ?

So all the characters can be his imagination to dive deeper 
So the 3rd level is where he has the top and the 4th is when he has the ring 
He’ll always come back to the 3rd level when he had the top because that’s the only level when he has access to Mal’s top locked inside the safe

So in my opinion he’s wayyyy Farr from the real reality

that backyard scene, he never sees his children's face thats y they're faces never showed up in his dream.
u all stuck with that top totem. well played Nolan... 

oh this is what Michael Caine said if u all still wanna argue:
In an interview with Esquire magazine, Michael Caine, who played Cobb’s mentor and father-in-law, said Nolan had explained the film to him. “When I got the script of Inception, I was a bit puzzled by it, and I said to (Chris), ‘I don’t understand where the dream is’. I said, ‘When is it the dream and when is it reality?’
""He said, ‘Well, when you’re in the scene it’s reality.’ So, get that – if I’m in it, it’s reality. If I’m not in it, it’s a dream,” he added. Now because Caine did feature in the final scene featuring Cobb and his kids, it means the scene was reality and not a dream.

Interstellar is another good one - the cinematography is sublime, particularly the scenes going through the wormhole and the black hole.",2023-05-08T13:29:56Z

Watch Michael caine's speech
And you will understand

This movie was genius
Not because it knew how to put forth 
A hypothesis like any PhD would
But also left enough room for faith

The fact is
Objective reality vs subjective reality
Is the universal argument

Keep on dreaming!!!!!!
Or
It's time to wake up!!!!!!

Nolan you sly fox

Your the director we deserve
At the ""time "" we ""deserve"" it

I remember waking suddenly, looking at the blue Rabbit and being self aware for that period of time, before turning around and going back to sleep. I remember a  strange feeling of 'before' even although I would not have been able to articulate that. I believe that consciousness is not singular but neither is it explainable.

At the end he frees the client from limbo, as well as himself and (supposedly) wakes back up in reality. The spinning top at the end is a cliffhanger as it’s left up to the viewer to decide whether he’s in a dream or not.

Inception was an invitation to the filmmaker and to audiences that said (to quote Tom Hardy’s Eames), “You musn’t be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.” An ambitious sci-fi project with an all-star cast featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Hardy, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Ken Watanabe and Michael Caine, Inception blended heady concepts with crowd-pleasing blockbuster elements.

Time spent in Limbo passes SO SLOW for the mind. And Cobb did not want to be there, for so much of it.
Then back in the real world, he still never really got Mal back, and always blamed himself for damaging her.

He had suffered so much and worked so hard to get back, I wanted a BIG REDEMPTION for him very bad and was VERY disappointed when it was left unclear.

To this day, I use the scene on the plane with each of those experienced extractors all smirking and smiling and all seemingly quite sure this was real, and they had made things right - as some sort of PROOF that he really was back in the real world, and really had cleared his name with the law, and could really just live a normal life with his kids.

XQPy88-E2zo,@SeNniN06,well what threw people into believing it being a dream is the fact that his kids are wearing the same clothes as he last saw them.   It's been done intentionally to leave the audience wondering if it was a dream but I'm pretty sure Nolan made it clear it's not a dream.  He did say the ending is opening to either of the conclusions of it being a dream or reality as well.,2022-04-15T09:53:29Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@DavidGinnFilm,"@MooMoo69556 Morbius is the actual GOAT. Jared Leto is the best at whatever he acts, and I can barely act like a human. Daniel Espinosa is groundbreaking, setting up a universe that everyone around the world accepted, including Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and more who hated superhero films, but now are changed men and women. The music, cinematography, set design, cast, everything and everyone on this film is perfect and don’t deserve to go to Heaven, but a place better than Heaven. Thank you Daniel and Jared for creating a modern masterpiece, and keeping the life of Stan “The Morbius” Lee alive. Stan Lee just walked out of his grave, and went to the El Capitan just to watch this, and is now a Morbius connoisseur and collector. By the time this film turns 1 year old, cinema would’ve already changed into different directions, because Morbius made such an impact. So thank you to the Morbheads who made this modern masterpiece, and here’s to more Morbius sequels (which equals more modern masterpieces and changes in cinema).",2022-12-06T17:19:59Z

This scene was created to intentionally be ambiguous. If we were supposed to understand that this was reality, the film would have been cut after the totem toppled over, but it wasnt. 

I think also the point of this ending was Cobb walked away from the top. Every scene before this, he needed to see the top to topple to verify he was in reality yet, this is the first one he walks away from. He no longer cares, it no longer matters to him. He's with his children. 

Also, interesting tidbit. His son says ""look what i've been building, we're building a house on a cliff"" may mean nothing, but all dialouge is intentional.",2022-12-21T00:25:04Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T19:10:34Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@diegoh1458,"@danielhamilton351 not the way I saw it. if you think ab the state of limbo. the only way Cobb and mal got out of it originally was because they killed themselves after he planted the idea in mals head. in Saitos case we can tell he'd been down there awhile by his aged looks, meaning the sedative was close to wearing off in the real world, further proved by the point that after they take their lives, there's only 20 mins before they land after a 10 ish hour flight. The main thing for me though that proves they weren't lost in limbo at the end, is the movie itself. The whole time we're reminded of Cobbs great ""sin"" and guilt by planting thr idea in mal's head that gets them out of the limbo state but gets her killed. That fact alone we know makes Cobbs reality actual reality. At the end of the movie Cobb goes to find Saito in limbo. This time though Cobb's aware of how difficult it might be to not only get Saito out, but to get him out without ruining him. He does this by reminding saito to not be an old man filled with regret and waiting to die alone, but to be young men together again which is a beautiful call back to the beginning, but is also the idea that convinces saito to comeback to reality.

long story short Cobb learned from his past of what not to do based off prior experience that enabled him to succeed with bringing saito back. Reoccurring theme actually. him succeeding in itself is how we know he gets out cause he failed countless times in general. I dare say his guilt keeps him grounded or is like a totem for him too. Also Michael cane  said that whenever he's on scene is when Cobb is experiencing reality.  just a couple reasons why I think he actally made it back to his family",2023-04-27T02:32:55Z

If we were to assume that the ending was in the dream world, then the totem will have kept spinning indefinately.  The character would have eventually spotted that after meeting his children and realized it was a dream. Then taken steps to come out of the dream.

XQPy88-E2zo,@naveengoyal5243,"The below article will help you guys.

According to NME, Caine appeared at a recent screening of the 2010 sci-fi classic.

The 85-year-old said: “When I got the script of Inception, I was a bit puzzled by it.

“And I said to him, ‘I don’t understand where the dream is.’

“I said, ‘When is it the dream and when is it reality?’

“He said, ‘Well, when you’re in the scene it’s reality.’ So, get that — if I’m in it, it’s reality. If I’m not in it, it’s a dream.”

Taking this on board the final shots of Inception saw Caine’s Miles pick up Cobb at the airport before taking him home to his children.

So surely this means it was reality and the spinning top was about to drop?

If anything the fact that it was starting to shake surely confirms this since it didn’t wobble when Cobb was actually in a dream.

Back in 2015 Nolan himself gave a cryptic answer to the question that’s been bugging fans for almost a decade.",2022-11-14T04:36:36Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@JTVH2007,"The ending with the top isn’t even the most emotional moment for me. It’s when he’s walking through the airport showing all the side characters. There isn’t any heart felt goodbyes or even a nod to Arthur or Eames. You just see them look at each other in a split second. And then finally Fisher sees Cobb and it seems like he recognizes him. I’d like to think he realizes in that moment who he is, but decides that it doesn’t matter, and that what comes in the future is more important. Side note: What I would do to just see Michael Caine waving at me at an airport waiting for me to come home… that man is amazing.",2021-11-28T15:46:35Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@cja5612,I wonder why they didn't say any goodbyes,2022-06-19T23:43:07Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@andrewmiller3055,"Agreed. Walking through the airport, a fairly normal experience, is a triumph here and the movie makes it a triumph.  It's pretty extraordinary.",2022-07-10T12:10:09Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@andrewmiller3055,"re the team, I think they all recognized they pulled off an impossible mission, and that in some sense it was not just for their own experience but also for Cobb, so that he could go home.  They are proud of Cobb.  Also they probably didn't want to tip off Fischer - there's a reason for the muted celebration.  I get the sense these teams are freelance anyhows, so once a mission is accomplished it's on to the next one - they go home, lay low, then go wherever it's needed.  Still extraordinary to see a normal moment take on such gravity.  Same with the final scene in Dark Knight Rises etc third film for Batman trilogy for Nolan.  Endings where fairly normal moments take center stage.",2022-07-10T12:16:06Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@beafrancescabufi3953,"Yup. There’s a reason for the muted celebration. They didn’t want to tip off Fischer, remember, this guy knows about Inception. He’s trained to defend himself from it, it was already a miracle in itself   that they were able to pull this off. 

Another reason would probably be because they literally just pulled off a crime. They drugged Fischer and dragged him into a shared dream without his consent. Sure, they shared some knowing glances, but in their minds they knew they had to ignore each other and go on with business as usual so as not to get caught. But yeah, it was pretty visible that they were proud of what they did. 

You know how you share that look with your friend after you cheat on a test? That shared look of conspiracy, smirk of confidence and disbelief that you two were able to pull that off? That’s kinda what’s up here.

I love how Arthur gives Cobb a ghost of a nod at 1:55 It was almost as if he was mentally telling Cobb “ You’re free. We did it, I have no regrets. See you soon, brother.”",2022-08-31T14:05:45Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@rajeshchaurasiya9,@cja5612 because that would raise suspicion. Imagine they all hand shake and talk about mission. Don't you think fisher would assume what would have been the mission. Remember he had had training to protect his Mind from such kind of invasion.,2022-10-11T13:30:46Z

Of course as everybody knows the whole group targeted Fisher.
For me , the ending is real because in dreams he wears a ring but in reality he doesn't , you can clearly see that he doesn't wear it , and that spinning is about to fall over anyway .",2021-11-24T22:43:48Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T20:13:06Z

At the end of the movie as  he is kissing Melina. the scene fades to white not black is Houser coming out of the memory he paid for or not??? Ron Shussett and Dan o Bannon came up with the dreamscape adventure 20 years before Nolan. So let's give credit were it's due first. They also wrote script for Alien 1979.

XQPy88-E2zo,@nosajc0okies364,"@stokedd Its fake, heres my opinion, Why are his kids the exact way hes been imagining them throughout the film, how deep did him and his wife go, remember he resolved guilt within one of the dream phases, and allowed himself to visualize his children, this doesnt mean hes out of a dream, its exactly as he left it, what he knows not what he feels. Many loops, and has many great elements and lessons. Was the story about him getting pressured to help a chinese guy stop a business from going under and a global take over from happening, or was it about him coming to peace with him and his wife separating.

THE KEY: It's his wife spinner not his, so if it stops, its cause he knows it will stop and create it. 
Additionally: could this guy have potentially left his wife in a lower dream state and stole her piece and lied about it. It's like him and his wife did the dream sharing as couples therapy, turned out bad, he knew he could manipulate her after the fact, climbed a dream state, felt guilty about it, got over it, and moved on without her and is slowly progressing back through the dream states. What if the whole movie is about him incepting his own brain to allow him to get over the guilt, and he has convince himself that what hes doing is for the greater good.",2022-04-14T13:16:41Z

For the most part it is because of what Michael Caine said but more so because the children act out in a very personal way that doesn’t seem distant nor ethereal. Also, when the kid says, “We’re building a house on a cliff,” well that can be chalked up to ‘kids say the darndest things’ even tho they are known to make sand castles etc. While all this is compelling information, the way it is shot lends it to be open for interpretation and one could argue that it could be a dream regardless, nobody can definitely say it’s one or the other in the abstract.

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T19:59:58Z

Even though time moves slower in dreams it still should have been a while because he was working and shit. It would never in a million years be possible in reality that the time he sees them again will be extremely similar to his memory of the last time he saw them. It's only because it's not real. His brain can only contruct this image of his children because this was how he saw them the last time. He just doesn't know it because he went through all this. And he is finally with his children.

אלא יש לנו בעיה עם רשעים שרוצים להיות שותפים....וממלאים תאוות כתר רשעים בדימיונם.

ברוך וברוך שמו העומד וחי וקיים לעד שאין איש מאיתנו אפילו אחד אי פעם גע באישה באמצעות כסף או ניצל אותה ועוד

4. ההם שואלים למה אנחנו משתגעים ןצורחים ומקללים..והריי רשעים ועוד הורגים בשביל כסף....ואומרים מה אומרים או בשביל כיסא ומעמד......פה מדובר בשיעבוד אכזריי אשר מסתכם בזה שמעל 90 אחוז נלקחים מחייו של האדם כולל לחץ מטורף ושווה ערך ללבנים שהרמנו במצריים רק ההינדוס בזווית וצורה מיוחדת...חבלנים חכמים

אז ברגע שצדיק אמיתי יוצא משליטה ישר הרשעים תראה אותו...כך בו3חים ומשנים כיוון מי מעשם..כי הריי מלוכלכים בשנאת חינם ןעוד..יונקים מי כתר רשעים...חכו יש תוספות..שנאת חינם ומלחמות ואכזריות ותרבות ודיבור מגעיל ונגוע.

אצל נוח בלי דיבורים ובלי צאנסים ולא צעקות....פותר הכול..פחות מי 5 דקות...תלוי על איזה יהודים נופלים...
אצל משה וציפורה ואהרון ועוד..נתנו צאנסים
צאנס..מתח גבוהה..סכנה.

רשעים הורגים בשביל כסף ועוד..ופה צשיק מסלק את השנאת חינם ומלחמת אחים שזה רק תוספות אל תשכחו שיעבוש נוראי מלווה בלחץ..

איזה זול אתה צריך להיות כדי לגעת באישה דרך כסף...איך השם אומר זה יותר גרוע מי שמרטוט ריצפה..שמרטוט ריצפה בהרבה יותר נקי...איזה זול גבר צריך להיות לנצל את הצד החלש והחצי השני שלו באמצעות כסף...כלומר הצד החזק טורף כארייה את הצד החלש...

אלא הדתי התפלא שאצלינו איש בחיים לא נגע ולא יגע באישה בשביל כסף או ינצל אותה מינית ועוד שטויות שם או משפיל ופוגע בנשים במעמד חלש שאולי עברו דבריים בחיים והארגון הזה עוד מי מצריים...
עוד מי מצריים...ולך תסביר זאת
וואווו זה לקחת אויר
אצלינו בחיים אף אחד לא היה בבית בושת..ואיך אומרים כמה זול אתה לגעת באישה בשביל כסף וההיא שם כלואה ורוצה להיות משהו וכסף...שלא נדע וההוא בא מנצל אותה והולך....
ובעל הסולם הסביר במשפטו כי זה כתם שנשמר לעד...שלא נדע...כתם כתם
לנצל צד חלש באמצעות כסף וביריונות...
כלומר גם בתחית המתים הכתם היה שם...
שלא נדע...
כמה צריכים להיות שמחים ומאושרים צדיקיים אמיתיים יהודים וגם לא,
אבל כרגע מדברים על יהודים..כמה צריכים להיות שמחים שלא נפלו באש השטן ודרכו
כי הכתמים...ומצודה פרוסה וכול מעשיהם נרשמים...נרשמים..נרשמיים..בספר החיים
ולא חסר נשים שהפילו ילדים להרואין ועשו שיחשוחים ושנאת חינם ועוד
...
בעל הסולם רומז ששם עומק החטא..אין סוף
כי מההוא היה צריך להגיע שושלת אך ההיא הרסה את הילד או שיחשחה בין גברים ועוד

אלא בתחית מתים רק השם מחליט גם אחריי התשובה
שארית עימך ופליטת בית סופריהם..היו נא רחמייך..והריי כול תפלית 18 אנו קוראים זאת...
לכן אותם היהודים שלא נפחו באש השטן
שטן=היתנהגות,תרבות,שנאת חינם,מלחמת אחים ושיעבוד שזה הכי קריטי אצל השם כי הורג בכמויות אדירות יהודים.
כמה אותם היהודים התמימים ובעליי תרבות ולא פוגעים או מעליבים אנשים...והלכו בדרך התורה אך ללא יודעין כי שורשם....כלומר לא שמרו שבת ולא מצוות אך דרך ארץ הייתה שם וצריכים מוביל שיקרבם לתורה
כפי שהיא..ויש דתיים הרבה מאוד בבני ברק וגם נחמנים וגם חסידות גוק ועוד אשר אם תרבות נפחאה ומוח מובהק ואינם פוגעים או מעליבים ואין השטן אוחז בהם...אלו הם אשר צריכים להיות בשמחה עד הגג...ובתחית המתים נשמתם לא תהיה נבוכה ויעמדו בכבוד...
כמה זול צריך להיות גבר לגעת באישה בשביל כסף, או לנצל אותה ואז לזרוק אותה...
השטן ורגליו, 
הם בתחית המתים אולי עכב החטא לא יתעוררו...
ניצלת חולשה 
דעו  ואסור לספר זאת אך כן
היו אנשיי שבק ומוסד במסע ואפילו ראש ממשלה אינו יודע וכנל בכירים בתוך האירגונים לא יודעים אך מריחים.

שער 
3301

אצלינו איש בחיים לא ניצל אישה ובחיים לא נגע באישה בשביל כסף אוי ואובי...
אהבה אמתית בין איש ואישה אינו ניצול אלא אותו האחד מיתענג...
אין חוצץ
אצלינו איש בחיים לא היה בבית בושת או ניצל אישה...אבל לגעת באישה באמתעות כסף....בונה אתה שמרטוט ריצפה
וכארייה צד חלש..ממש כך
לא רק לא רק
הם שואלים למה אנחנו צורחים ומשתגעים ומקללים ועוד ..כאילו נלחמים אנחנו על אגו או כסף ועוד שטיות....בונה אנשים בשביל כסף יוצאים מי שליטה ומדברים מה מדברים וההורגים גם....
פה נלחמים על שיעבוד אכז4י בקנה מידה שלא נתפס בכלל, לעבוד 12 שעות או 8 בסוף זה מסתכם בהרבה יותר שעות ..כולל נסיעות ולקום שעה מי לפני לעבודה.
זה שווה ערך ללבנים שהרמנו במצריים מי בחינת משקל...כולל הלחץ המטורף,
כמה יהודים התאבדו ונכחדו במערכת הזאת..כנל גם אצל לא יהודיים

רק מי זה...עכשיו זה מלווה כלומר תוספות בשנאת חינם ומלחמת אחים ותרבות מאוד רעה ומגעילה של היתנהגות בזוייה , ופוכגעים ומעליבים יהודים ועוד השם שלא נדע כי ה...

והם שואלים למה אנחנו משתגעים ומקקללים וכול האמת בחוץ ואיך חבר כוהן אמר..מרוקאי שכרגע שוהה בחול,
אמר זה מזכיר לי את הגטו ומחנות השמדה ועוד..אמר הנצאים באו בפנים..ופה בתחבולות עושים את זה. 
צריך לצום על אותם נשמות 


שנפלו בזוהמה.
על כסף הם הורגים ועושים מה עושים...לא מדברים אלא הורגים...
דעו תלוי על איזה יהודיים נופלים אם זה היה נוח אז זה היה נסגר ב5 דקות בדיוק ובלי שום דיבורים...אצל משה ואהרון וציפורה והנשים של משה ועוד הרבה זה בצאנסים היה במצריים..כלומר. נתנו צאנסים...
ואלא שואלים למה אנחנו מדברים לא יפה...
נו באמת מה זה נראה לכם צחוקים ושטיות שהשם אין לו שום בעיה אם שטיות וצחו2ים ובר לבב....
השם ישמור פולחנים של רשעים נעשו על האדמה הזאת...והתמימים ושארית עימך ופליטת בית סופריהם וצדיקים אמיתיים,
חוששים לחיים שלהם....
שהשטן מנסה להסביר עצמו ועובד על מפגרים אך מול צדיק אמיתי נופל כפירור..
כמה צריכים להיות שמחים דתיים ולא דתיים שלא נפלו באש השטן, והיו מתורבתים..לא העליבו ולא פגעו...ועמדו לצד חלשים שנפגעו מרשעים בכול מיני דרכים...ולגעת באישה שהיא עדינה ומעודנת וחלשה ביחס לגברים...וההוא מנצל אותה באמצעות כסף,
אחד כזה מחוק אצל השםם..חתיכת נבלה קטנה רשע כזה


זה לא אהבה בין איש לאישה שאותו האחד מיתענג.

תבינו מובהקים בצורה קיצונית נדהמו
להבין כמה מבריק הוא ונחל שופע של נסתרות
אמת
ואיך באחת הפגישות, הדתי מבני ברק
אמר, 
אנשים לא מבינים שלרוץ אחריי הכסף לא מוביל לשום מקום.....ומוביל רק לכיוון
אחד
אדמה...
אלא לפי הצורך ..כלומר למשה יש נשים גם בארץ וגם בחול, אז צריך 
וגם שם כול אישה, לא קיבלה ארמון
בית נוח ומספיק כדי לחיות בשלווה
כי אין הכסף הוא יעד....אלא מוביל 
לתהום בסוף

כלומר נניח אדם עובד 5 שעות ביום ומקבל משכורת טובה ובקלות חיי אזי
אין צורך ב 20 מכוניות, ו30 חדרים ועוד 12 מרפסות ועוד שבוע הוא מוסיף עוד 2 מרפסות
זה אדם שהמוח שלו כמו מחשב מפורמט
אלא שאר הזמן צריך להשקיע לחקור עוצמתו(טבע) יתברך
כי
כי
כי
אין קץ לחקר גודלתו
כלומר
בעת הישיבה הדתי אמר שימשיכו לרוץ אחריי כסף ונראה איפה יגיעו בסוף

למשה יש אוצרות ולא מעט מכוניות ובתים
למה? כי כמות הנשים
נשים למופת ואין שום פריצות ולא כלום ולא אגו ולא שיחשוחים רעים..אלא מדברים מה אלא עושות שם ואלא שם וההיא כך וזאת כך ...לא רובוטים אסור לדבר

הרבה ידעו מה הדתי מבני ברק הסביר רק שירד לעומק....וסיכם זאת כך
שימשיכו לרוץ אחריי הכסף ונראה לאיפה יגיעו
והדתי הדגיש שזה מעין מותרות הרבה כסף..אך פה התהום יותר משוכלל
כלומר הסתנוור מאוד חזק
כסף מעוור עיניי צדיקים נאמר
ויש צדיקים אמיתיים כך רשום
כלומר יודעים שסכנה היא לרוץ אחריי הכסף,
אלא ילמד ויחכים ויחקוק ויחצוב נסתרות
הטבע..כי זאת המתנה הכי גדולה שאין קץ לגודלה

למשה יש כמנ ערנקיים של ביטקיון אם לא מעט כסף
והוא שכח את הקוד הסודי
וזה בכלל לא מעניין אותו אבל ברמה כזאת כאילו בכלל לא היה קיים...
איך הדתי אמר המחדש ביומו
לחקור וללמוד ביחד בזוגות כול יום משהו חדש..הפתעות...אתגרים ועוד
וזה מחדש את הקשר בין בני הזוג
למה אדם צריך 30 בתים ...למה
לוקח זמן ליפול לאסימון הדתי אומר
שהאסימון נופל

עבר מה עבר....
היה שייך לספינת משה והיעד שהם מכוונים,
אמר ברוך הוא וברוך שמו אין אני חלק במה 
שעשו ...ואמר לנו הדתי אחריי שעבר את המסע , וזה מסע כמו 80000 אלף מסע קומטה...בהרבה יותר...בפועל
אמר כך הרמבם תיאר זאת עוד בזמנו וראה כבר במוחו מה היה היום והיחיד שהוא מעין הוחכה חותכת כי אליהו ומשה ועוד נביאים זה מעין סיפור לחלק...בהדרגה
הרמבם הוחכה חותכת...לא רק הכין את ספרו מורה הנבוכים..לשער שיגיע בדור הזה

הדתי אמר הרמבם תיאר זאת כך ופרצו בחוכמתם לבית המלך והשחיטו הכול

והשחיטו הכול הדתי אמר לנו זאת מילה מורכבת מאוד,
ומלאה רבדיים ואמר מלחמת אחים ומלחמת דמים ופולחנים מרושעים ועוד הכניסו את שיא הטומאה אבל המיץ של הזבל לתוך ארמון המלך=בית המלך
השחיטו גם הכוונה אינם מבינים את התורה כראוי...ואף גרעו והוסיפו
משה רבינו היה הראש והראשון אם ציפורה ואהרון ועוד שלחמו על זכיות האדם בעולם והשיעבוד הנוראי שלאנשים שהתרגלו הכול בסדר ועוד מסנוורים אותם שהכול בסדר
והשחיטו גם מדבר על הרבנים גם בתקפות מצריים שמכרו נרות קדושיים, ואמרו תהיו שמחים בחלקכם ועוד....השוט...השטן ..רק שינה צורה
משה ריבנו גם שיחרר גויים במצריים,
לחופש מוחלט והשאיר להם הכול שם
נראה לכם תורת משה דוגלת בזה שכול העולם ימחק או כול הגויים צריכים למות
איך הדתי מבני ברק אמר
זה הסוף שלנו ,
כי יש לא מעט שם שלא קשורים לכלום ואף תרמו לעתיד עולמנו בכמויות אדירות בכיוון של דרך ארץ ועוד
כלומר הדתי מבני ברק אומר השורשים של היהודים...מושרשים ככה....להפיך הגמור
בתחליט הפועל למה שקורה כבר עשור בישראל....שם השפע מגיע משנאת חינם ומלחמות ושיחשוחים ומעשים חשוכים ...

שאוי אבון לשעבד אדם 12 שעות ללא נסיעות וללא לקום שעה מלפני....כך היה אצל פרעה שעות ארוכות אם הפסקות קצרות ברורות ואוי תעבור....
והריי משה ידע שאין טעם לדבר עם פרעה על קיצור שעות כי פרעה זה משהו שינק מכוחות אפלים באמת.....אך אמת?
הדתי הסביר כי פרעה יגיד לך בדיחה טובה

זה
זה
לא איש עסקים שיקשיב וישנה דעתו
אלא רשע אפל היה כי אין על מה לדבר,

מי זה היה משה?
הוציא יום חופש בשיא העבדות אך לקצר שעות ידע אין טעם לדבר כי פרעה לא איש עסקים, אלא משהו אפל הולך שם
כי לקצר שעות לא יקרה....

וכן היא דרכו של משה במצריים הייתה כך...

Hans Zimmer is on John Williams level of composing score for film, and he's a master of his craft - but silence is also something which tells, sometimes even as much as music. Roaring orchestral music does not make a movie, the movie does. If it doesn't work without the music, like, at all, then your film is shit and the score simply saves it. I think this scene would work better with silence, or at least a subdued score, and better convey the emotions felt by the involved characters.",2022-09-11T13:04:18Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@john.james-rambo,"​@gandalf8216 

I understand you bro. 
But I believe Hans pulled off something which really beautifully captures the emotions of Cobb in this score. 
And as @Kleeblättchen mentioned ""in the case of inception there is nothing to worry about because the film is just as good and the score complements it perfectly but generally speaking it's not easy to have a perfectly fitting score that neither overshadows the visuals and words nor being too subtle..."". 

The entire score (how I felt when I watched this movie) was, it perfectly captured the entire transition from Cobbs shock to the reality he comes to terms with.
As the suble beginning of the score perfectly captures the shock Cobb is in and trying to come to terms with it trying to absorb the entire sequence and seeing the team he was with all being fine and knowing he would be able to see his family when Saito makes the call, the score holds it tone to make a transition to get him a level off of his shock and comes closer to the counter which is his biggest one to get away from as the visa gets chopped and then as the guitars kick in to sweeten the shock for what he has now started to feel the accomplishment of his actions whilst the shock starting to fade away even more making him much more relaxed and he feels proud of his actions as he walks away from his team and gives the energy to look at Murphy to know he did it as score holds at those notes rising to the most awaited sequence of the movie has he managed to get to his most cherished kids he despertely wanted to see but there still little more left of the shock makes him take the only thing he could verify if he is in reality and the music stops as his heart stops in fear to see if the kids would turn and if he could see their faces and then. . .  they do turn and the music kicks to a tone to make us realize his shock is now almost completely gone from him as he managed to be verbal with his kids and the top starts to throttle and give away it's axis as the music abruptly ends on the notes of violin to say that the only string which might have had on that shock has finally got completely now removed off of his mind as the movie title is in full display "" I N C E P T I O N "" - DAMNNNNN ! SIMPLY DAMN !",2022-09-21T19:58:35Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@john.james-rambo,"@gandalf8216 

I also could add further more undertones why Hans Zimmer might have added them with bit of a music knowledge I have but rather than the technical sides I will try to explain the tones and why and how some feel related to it.

At the beginning the base heavy sides makes us feel sort of a removal of gradual sadness towards a tone of accomplishment that part why is left to feel sort of sad using some undertones are because the loss of his wife at the end which was something he was finding really hard to come to terms with. So when you wake up from such a task you are already sad that you have finally let her go to come to terms with much more realistic things worth living for like his kids. While the pain and accomplishment resides in his heart as soon as he wakes up and starts to look around and his team mates are gesturing that they managed to pull of the task it's a triumphent victory with a lot of emotional baggage at the end of his heart with the glimpse of hope hoping to see his kids as he sees Saito makes that call. Then trying to stick a leg and face the ultimatum the music sort of cuts real low before the guitar notes kicks in because no matter what you go through reality is a whole another thing so he is trying to make an emotional transition despite his sadness, shock and hope to act normal infront of the cop hoping nothing would get triggered with a lot of nervousness. But soon after the welcome home Mr. Cobb is heard that shocks kicks in again but in a more controlled fashion but now his mind is much more in a relaxed state because now the achievemnet takes presedence over the sadness and shock he was in because as soon as he walks out he would see his kids. As the notes develop his sadness and worries further depleats off of his heart which helps him to smile for the visible first time as he sees his father because he is getting real close to the closure he has been waiting for that remining shock and sad factors are the thing is why he looks at his father like he still cannot believe it that they;ve made it, his comfort levels are increasing as the trumphets at high notes signifies that making him look around in a much more relaxed manner soon after his father departs from the screen at the airport at the time 2:32. But as the score holds he wants to check one last time if everything is really okay because now he can make some moves as his body trying to find the equilibrium of mind allowing the body to fuction towards knowing the truth one last time. But as he hears his father speaking to the kids the score is at his highest point of making a rational decision of what he wants ahead in life. And as soon as the score closes to the reveal of faces the emotions are all in halt of silence because he is scared. But then he immediately comes to terms to the reality he is in connecting from that emotional bubble he has been all this time to the reality trying to convey using the highest of notes of the violin to emphasize there is nothing much left to explain in his emotions because he is now entirely getting ready to accept and ACT on that reality. 

So to finalize everything as a summery, this last ending was not a portrayal of what was going on through a 3rd person's view but a view through Cobbs emotions by the viewers eyes. That is why we feel so emotional with so many tones to it.

Hope all of you enjoyed this masterpiece just as much as I did.

Thank you.

Peace.",2022-09-21T20:30:51Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@Kyrieru,"@gandalf8216 Hans Zimmer is such a weird case. I look at things like the Lion King Soundtrack, and then compare it to soundtracks now, and they're at totally opposite ends of the spectrum despite being the same guy. The average movie soundtrack these days is staccato strings and some legato brass and boomy drums.

XQPy88-E2zo,@autumnhd,"​@ratha_bhabatosh I haven't seen the movie in a while but from what I remember, in a dream, you pull from your subconscious. The people that Cillian saw on the plane would have been the last people he saw before going to sleep. It would make sense then that the characters in his dream would pull from his subconscious and his recent memory. As per why he, knowing about extraction, didn't grow suspicion about the people on the plane: Cillian would have thought that the dream level that took place in New York was real life, and that the hotel dream was the 1st dream level that the extractors were using to get information from him. Cillian doesn't know about inception, but he was trained to be resiliant towards extraction. He thought that he was kidnapped at new york, and was being extracted in the hotel dream. Then, when what he thinks are his guards (which are actually the inception crew) convinced him that it was his uncle trying to extract information from him (in the hotel), Cillian then thought he was entering his uncles sub-concious to extract information from him. From Cillian's perspective, back on the plane after the whole ordeal, his guards (actually the inception crew) were character models pulled from his memory of the people he saw on the plane.",2022-02-06T11:01:52Z

So, in that state it had to drop, it's just that watching it drop is not that important in comparison to the scene of their ""reunion"". And that's the message of this ending scene -- That -- ""The reality is more important than the dream."" 
Hence, no matter how intense or attractive a dream is (the one you saw while sleeping or fantasy) the fact is it is a dream and one needs to stop obsessing about it. Unless you go into ""reality"" and do something about it.

XQPy88-E2zo,@darthvader2158,"Maybe
But the way I like to interpret is different
Cobb couldn't differentiate dream and reality. He needed the help of a totem for it.
But after the inception events he regains his sense of reality and accept his wife's death.
He finally understands what's real. So he doesn't need that totem anymore.
It's about getting sense of reality and getting over the truama and the guilt due to his wife's death.

In short he doesn't need a f*cking totem to know what's real.
What's real is in front of him.
The love towards the children.
Love is real.",2022-05-14T02:10:08Z

But doing 2-3 lifetimes will leave you worn out, even if you do wake up younger. Aside from the stress the brain activity will leave on your body, you'll see life as less precious. Say in one lifetime, you and your kid get into a fight and they move out at 18 and never speak to you again. Do you try to reconcile? Or just wait to die again and try again? When you don't have one shot at something, you take more risks and take it less seriously.

Until you reach the life where it is reality, and there are no new chances, but you don't know that. You could try to live each life as though it were your last, but it cheapens as you have memories from your past life that essentially amount to nothing.

Until you do what Mal does and kill yourself to reach true reality.",2021-05-26T17:41:05Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@hanniballecter5383,"@solomonchilds8574 yes it was, and Cobb said that the whole totem idea was mal's, so Cobb couldn't have had one before the spinner",2022-06-25T01:13:28Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@solomonchilds8574,@hanniballecter5383 yep correct. Then Cobb would have made an item of his into his totem,2022-06-25T07:10:29Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@ctrlaltdelaet,"The totem is the totem he’s always had. He decided to spin the totem when he sees his kids and returns home because he’s suspicious as to whether he’s in real life or another dream. When he sees his kids, he looks away from the totem, after being eager to see whether it would fall or not. I feel when he sees his kids, he doesn’t care whether he’s in a dream or reality anymore. This is a scenario he has always wanted to be in, and whether it’s a dream or not, he doesn’t care after all. 

I do think that he was in reality though, the totem was spinning at the end and looked as if it was going to fall. I don’t like any of these theories about whether it was Mal’s wedding ring, I don’t think it makes any sense. And if that theory was real, it would ruin the entire story in my opinion.",2022-06-27T21:38:54Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@5nixie,"Yeah, true. Also, the top had already started to wobble towards the very end.

В этом фильме рассказывается история любви Джека и Роуз (их играют Леонардо Ди Каприо и Кейт Уинслет), которые пришли из разных социальных слоев на борту Титаника RMS, затонувшего во время своего первого рейса 15 апреля 1912 года. 00:01

XQPy88-E2zo,@pendragonshall,"@harrisoncarranza41 I know you meant well and so do I. However, masks are useless against viruses and are actually harmful. I was medically trained in their usage and the very companies themselves tell you that just like the packages now tell you they do NOT stop covid or ANY microbial viruses. 
I had to purchase a half face multifilter microbial virus mask for my work several years ago (along with wearing full body protective gear) and I am 100% telling you the truth. Masks are actually harmful EXCEPT if you are exposed or have BACTERIAL airborne transferrel. Then they are somewhat to very effective. Like say for bacterial pneumonia but again are useless against VIRAL pneumonia. Surgeons wear them to keep particles from entering there mouth or your cavity when working.
Lot more to say but this is concise enough. Take care",2021-12-10T08:15:06Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@harrisoncarranza41,@pendragonshall here schools and jobs were requiring 2-3 masks! Ridiculous! One is enough! True that masks aren't guaranteed but it kind of gives us a sense of security. It's like condoms. Just because you use a condom doesn't mean you won't get pregnant. There's still a small chance that something escapes thru. At the end what's important is being careful.,2021-12-12T03:19:13Z

1. Apart from the top Cobb's personal totem was his wedding ring, in all his dream sequences he was wearing it. He was not wearing it here
2. Transportation, that is Cobb said people don't remember the beginning of a dream, they start of in random places. But here they're on the plane, they know exactly how they were there further proving it is real and not a dream.
3. Sound, if you listen carefully the sound of the top is consistent throughout but at the end it becomes feeble indicating it is slowing down and coming to a halt, thus indicating Cobb is finally free and back to his reality.

But the most important thing is not living wondering/dreaming/remembering the past because only in the future there is true happiness. Accept the past but go on.

XQPy88-E2zo,@hatuminator7247,"That cannot be his thoughts otherwise he would have avoided all these problems in the first place and just continued living in the dream world with his wife. The reason why he ""killed"" himself and his wife was cause he knew it wasn't real and even though he was very happy with his wife he decided to lay on the tracks with her and come back to reality cause he couldn't accept the fact that they're in the dream world he wanted them to live in reality. So why would he end up suddenly not caring about whether he's in a dream or not? And plus people are really complicating the ending its pretty OBVIOUS that he's in reality because throughout the whole movie whenever he's in a dream his totem was ALWAYS spinning perfectly smoothly non stop this is the FIRST TIME the totem started to wobble you can even hear it wobbling so it's obvious that he's in reality. I guess the director decided to end it before it falls to provide a sense of suspense and wonder within the audience cause you don't actually see it fall but we can all see and hear his totem wobbling hence it's about to fall hence he's in reality. And by the way this Hans Zimmer sound track is BEAUTIFUL! Gives me goosebumps every time I hear it and makes the ending so much better in every way!",2021-07-24T15:36:55Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@pikabuu6315,@hatuminator7247  i honestly believe that he is still in a dream. How can one explain that he meets his kids in the exact same situation and with the same clothes as he saw them in his other dreams. I guess Leo BELIEVES he is finally in the real world now and thus unconsciously made his totem function as if it were in the real world and why he wore the ring and where he cant manipulate this non-reality so that everything feels real. He didnt even care to look at the totem at the end of the movie because he believes this is his real world,2021-09-16T01:43:43Z

The limbo is the world we 're living in, and everyone who fell in there loses hope of getting out of it alive.

And Dicaprio get down to the limbo and tell ciyto to come back and believe him that they can get out of this painful world. And finally ciyto believe him and get out of the limbo sane.

So bascially ciyto could live by having faith. Dicaprio could be .. Jesus.

Nope. Body. Brain. Nerves. Neurons firing. This is shakti. This was actual east Indian philosophy. More than a philosophy. When neurons stop firing your brain dies. But still soul is intact. The oxygen that is running in your blood has to diminish. When that happens. When the oxygen in the blood is completely gone then only soul has left your body. Until then in ancient days no one declared death.

That's why in old days rakshash or demons (physical not mental) wanted your soul. Blood. This is the exact reason why most of the rituals in middle east and Europe used blood. Roflmao",2020-12-29T17:11:48Z

I like to remember this quote:  ""if you are good at something, never do it for free."" If you treat your hobby as a business you will begin to look for ways to improve your talent and accept feedback and influence personal and professional growth. Remember, at the end of the day, your hobby must become your primary source of income in order for you to pay your bills and put food on the table,  removing any worries about needing a boring 9-5 job.

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T19:38:09Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T19:44:01Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"@זאביגורוב 

Well, Zeev Yagorov, Moshe is who gave us YaH’s Holy Name. If you are talking about the “animal sacrifices”, YaH The Father did away with that with His Own Sacrifice. Praise YaH",2023-02-07T19:58:45Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@זאביגורוב,"@Praise___YaH  @Darrell Moore  
Who kill animels for god will be dead in the end.
**
Moses was far away from the real source.
I will prove you now
Few facts:
Our nature is based in the core on deadly bloody demonic hunting activity include the design,  where only the weak ones falls.. endless generations. People enjoy see how LIONS rip* off zebra and blood shrimps everywhere and all the organs is out...it's art for them, people see them self as lions, sharks, and son on...they shaped by mother hunter nature = lion beautiful, billions of views.
Darrel Moore you are tiny problem here..tiny little shit demon that approve killing especially weak animels for god*
Moses is in deep shit and I will prove you now....and was far away from the truth.

Imagine if we was burn to a nature where you have infinity of animels like zebra, gastropod rabbits, butterflys, infinity of animels in any kind size shape color and the right design* , how it would shape our way of thinking, love, design, pictures, behavior, understanding....
To see the design of the animels most of them in a dream or movie is a nightmare forever, but here it's hard core reality....not Hollywood effects.

It's also proved scientificly that the mind process information much more faster and get to goals faster when the things is sweet, without evil shit..it's proved. 

You tiny diamond Darrell Moore here..nature it self demonic...just look outside of the window... generations of wars, slavery, killings.

Only real true Jews can understand the secret that Jews hide...
I came from family that exist more then 2500 years from kavkaz/Armenia/Russia books was writed about our families...don't forget that the ark of Noah stopped in kavkaz/Armenia=Russia...the source of real true Jews...our family mixed Russian/kavkaz and more then 10000 people without counting kids.

Only real true Jews know what goes deep and deeper...

Now the only Jew that was close to the real source ..
It's was Daniel the oracle...
Daniel the oracle opened war against the lions...and only real Jews what it means...wait
Wait...the biggest oracle Jew yehezkel said he see Messiah as lion face ,eagle, mixture...
But
But
Daniel opened war against the lions...weird..
Lions is big word...like time delay...time delay can happen if you move to much faster or go through wormhole, big word...smart people know exactly what I mean...

When Daniel said he open war gainst the lions...he opened war against mother nature and the Jews them self...the prove is here.. yehezkel saw the Messiah as lion, eagle...evil design hunter animels which hunt only weak ones...
Daniel back then hinted he will kill the lion...
Now only real Jews the true meaning..
Daniel can reconstruct the entire nature with his mind...and get the lion out...Daniel hinted back then he will come back to end the war.
Lion is big word like time delay...
Lion = mother earth is hunter = wars = it's much deeper*

Daniel is one of 36 anonymous* zadakim...no less no more...read about it...
Daniel is one of angels from yakov solam(ladder), read about it...in the dream of yakov he saw a ladder and very big angles go up and down in this ladder...Daniel was one of them...Moses not*

The rivers of knowledge locked from evil place not only eyes...why Daniel got there...he was close to the real source....not only this

Daniel is like neo...he the first one opened war against the lions.

Lions is big word: lions is just a metaphor to represent our nature...

Now didn't you want to live in a nature with infinity of animels in any size shape, color, without the deadly bloody demonic activity, wars, ...just enjoy forever....just think how it would shape our way of thinking, design, live, pictures, understanding...we all as one move in this place forward and enjoy...

Daniel could reconstruct that nature from 
0
331
Daniel when opened war against the lions it's very deep...
Daniel stood with the weak ones...
Not only..Daniel hinted that he open war against his family the Jews...
The proves is here",2023-02-08T16:32:50Z

I think to myself oh yeah I’ll just watch a bit, scroll through some comments, catch some people commenting on the brilliant Nolan/Zimmer duo and leave. Nope..... not a single time. I’m just frozen..... I can’t pause the video and I can’t move. I’m paralyzed by this ending and everything about it. Just the sheer gravitas and feeling of success as if I PLANTED AN IDEA in Fischer’s head, glues me to the screen. I can’t say many films have made me feel that surreality.

So i saw this movie 30 times at least and ...
And still i can watch all over again
Yeah, i write this comment because i finnish him once more
Easy to gess which movie is my No.1 off all time ( and i saw a lot)

No.2 is interstelar... i can copy-paste type every single word from inception. 
He is No.2 just because he is younger than inception ( 4 years younger) so i didnt watched him 30 times, but 20 for sure

This 2 movies are simple above all others,
 because every single thing in this movies are simply masterpiece
Every single detail of that 2 movies are important, and there is no smarter human and there will never be like mr.nolan
There is not human who is able to make screenplay like mr.nolan. im so happy that i live in his era

Ofc. I was watched tenet, film is brutal amazing, but simply this 2 are above him

AND FINNALY

I have sleep paralysis. I have bad dreams, and I feel them seem incredibly real, I feel suffocation, falling, etc. and I want to wake up and I try to wake up but I fail I have developed some kind of defense where I try to shout and my wife knows I have these problems and knows everything I want is to wake up, when she hears my cry she immediately knows what it is, she shakes me and I wake up, I am aware of everything that happened to me, but simply the mind works and the body sleeps and no matter how hard I try to wake up, rarely when I succeed, it always my wife wakes up when she hears my cry. I turn to the other side and fall asleep in a second again, and when I remember the event again in the morning, my wife tells me you had paralysis last night, the answer is always that I know I had it myself, but I just couldn't wake up on my own
because of all this real life experience I believe Inception will be the best movie I have ever watched

The spinning top is losing it's balance as the scene fades out, ergo, if nothing else changes, it falls even if we don't see it fall and the only reason we don't see it fall is because we're removed from the event. But...it falls. We have to believe up until what we see. We can't invent or add on to what we don't see. 

The clue is in it's wobbling. Remember, when he spun it while dreaming, it had a flawless endless spin. In order to change the narrative, the top's spinning has to be flawless. It wasn't. 

If you go outside in the morning and it's wet, you can imagine (reasonably deduce) that it rained even if you didn't see it raining. That scene is a mindscrew on purpose. It's like believing that Mal was still alive even though she was Cobb's creation. You cannot reasonably believe that the top continued to spin. The physics makes it impossible.",2020-08-17T01:18:05Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T20:12:51Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@tylerbob2072,"I’m so glad that I get to study this masterpiece in Film! 

I honestly think that Cobb is still dreaming, or worse... being forced to relive the whole thing. Think back to the opening; when Cobb was dragged into Saito’s room, Mal burst in. After that dream, the film played out as usual... until Cobb was brought back to Saito. When Cobb told Saito “let’s be young men again”, we see him reach for the gun, but we don’t see Saito shoot himself to wake up. That’s because Mal burst in to interrupt the dream... meaning that the film (and experience) continues on as it originally did, replaying the experience. As a result, Inception is not only a dream, but a time-loop.

I know it sounds like a stretch, but that’s what I picked up on.",2020-07-26T21:56:06Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@xscale,"Earlier in the film we twice see how long the top spins in Cobb's real world. 18 seconds each time. In the last scene the top is still spinning after 44 seconds. So even if it were to fall during the end credits, there's no question that Cobb is dreaming here. The actual question Nolan's asking is who performed Inception on him and what idea did they implant?
We see Cobb find Saito in limbo. But then we see Saito reach for his gun ... and Cobb has already told us that, heavily sedated as they are, guns don’t kick you out. They send you deeper.
We don't know that Saito and Cobb are actually in limbo. We only know they are in a dream level below the one with Mal and Ariadne. When old Saito spins Cobb's totem and shoots Cobb, that's what sends Cobb to limbo where, as James says, in a house on a cliff, ""we're building a house on a cliff"".
That’s the only way Saito's phone call can eliminate Cobb's murder conviction. Doing so is impossible in real life. Saito's only problem was that he didn’t know the physical properties of Cobb's totem — how long it spins. Which is why the idea he implants in Cobb was to care more about seeing the children than checking the totem.

XQPy88-E2zo,@adityagupta1845,"Inception's plot is actually straight-forward and doesn't ""lie"" about when they are dreaming vs. the real world. What's brilliant about it is it incepts the idea that he isn't in reality at the end (even though he is), by planting the seed of the idea with the spinning top, JUST AS COBB DID WITH HIS WIFE. The audience ends up with the same affliction as she does—questioning the reality of the film, and coming up with elaborate and convoluted theories to support the idea that he's still in a dream. But there is no logical reason to believe he's still dreaming; the spinning top is the only reason we start doubting (if he hasn't spun the top and just went straight outside to see his kids, we wouldn't wonder if it's still a dream). Just like Cobb's wife had no logical reasons to doubt reality, only the nagging idea left behind from the spinning top in their dream.

XQPy88-E2zo,@nikunjdixit1175,"Dicaprio's performance in this movie is underrated. I know Inception is a highly regarded movie but when people talk about Dicaprio's best performances, they usually talk about his oscar nominated performances. I think this one is one of his best. Throughout the movie, I kept thinking there is something just a little off about him and it only hits you when they finally reveal at the end that he grew old with Mal in the dream world. What felt off about him was the fact that he had that weary and haunted look in his eyes of a man who had lived for far longer than he looked.",2020-06-17T06:08:20Z

The best ""remakes"" often take a deeper view of some of the original concepts and can use the original ideas to play little games and tricks with the ideas

I don't know why people make such a fuss about ""who sang a song first"" or which film is ""the Original""... just listen or watch and judge on merit.",2021-08-25T23:40:00Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is Our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T20:15:54Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@purpose6113,"​@darmus8928 Its not a copy. People who say that don't understand how creativity works. You can't create an original idea out of the blue sky. That's not how it works.

XQPy88-E2zo,@lucasfernandez5987,"Could someone help me out here?  When Cobb wakes up on the plane all of their equipment is off which means that the entire 10 hours that they were sedated is over.  10 hours on the plane is equal to a week in the first level.  Because they had to improvise after Saito was shot, they ended up accomplishing everything on the very first day in the first level.  This means that once they were all back in the first level they had to wait out the rest of the week (since Yusuf said that because they were to heavily sedated the only way to go back to the real world was to wait for the sedation to wear off).  Now the problem that I am getting to is this: if the entire 10 hours is over then that means that it has been over 150 years in limbo for both Saito and Cobb (since they BOTH entered Limbo on the first day of the week they were supposed to be in the first level).  So what I’m asking is if they both spent that much time in Limbo, why was Saito significantly older than Cobb was in Limbo?  Yes, I understand that Cobb entered Limbo after Saito did because Saito died first, however as I stated earlier, they both spent the rest of that 10 hours on the plane (which translates into about 180 years in limbo) in limbo.  So why the age difference?",2020-03-26T19:31:49Z

By the very nature of the work, he will likely never see his comrades again, despite effectively going through major ordeals with them and being by their sides for so long.

His departure from the airport and their quiet acknowledgements always were a hard pill for me to swallow.

It would be like if I never got to say goodbye to my war buddies, instead we simply got off the plane, nodded and never saw each other again.

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T19:19:02Z

But there was so much about this film that is hard to not scoff at and damn near impossible not to call attention to. There is so much greatness to this movie and it’s originality and score are undeniably great but I am baffled by the absurdity of this film. Like the idea that they figured out the different dimensions of time relativity in dreams is just like how could you have possibly come up with that? And what is the serum that they’re all connected to to put them into these dream realms? It’s exposition is a horse pill that is very hard to swallow. End of the day though, I would never knock anything Nolan does too much. How can you? He’s a god of a director.

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T19:32:00Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@SerbAtheist,"I am reposting this from another thread:

Inception 'Dream On Plane' theory:

Cobb is an ordinary business traveler who on a long flight home to see his kids met a guy named Fischer, chatted with him and afterwards fell asleep and had a particularly vivid dream. He is not in the future, there is no dream technology, he is not on the run from the authorities and he doesn't know 'Ariadne' or anyone else on the plane. He IS a widower, but in all likelihood he has not been apart from his kids for an extended period in time and can visit them and his in-laws taking care of them whenever he wants and his professional schedule permits it. 

The FIRST real moment in the movie is when Cobb wakes up on the plane startled. 'Saito's' phone call is a red herring. Cobb only exchanged glances and never words with anyone on 'his team'. In fact, 'Ariadne' gives him the 'you looking at me?' look, the kind you might give to a stranger staring at you for too long (not that she particularly minds given Cobb's attractiveness and outward indicators of success; this was not a 'stop staring at me, you creep' look). Afterwards, 'business mogul' Fischer passes through the general public terminal and is greeted by an ordinary taxi driver holding a rather humble cardboard name card. Then Cobb's FIL greets him at the Los Angeles airport and takes him to his place of residence, which does seem odd when you consider that earlier on he 'had' a teaching career in Paris. 

What else? Cryptic statements, such as 'Come back to reality' that dream FIL teaching in Paris utters at one point completely out of the blue. What does it even mean for Cobb? Ignore that he's a fugitive, that he can't see his children? And for that matter how difficult would it be to fly the children over to Paris where Cobb can ostensibly move around quite freely. Mal, whom we may remember is representative of his subconscious, also asks him to be skeptical of his situation. Cobb just brushes it off in a classic form of 'dream denial.' Even the illogical things about dream technology make sense: speeding up in the lower levels (do our brains explode?), limbo (telepathy?), dream machines INSIDE dreams and last but not least totems (if totems work a certain way you're used to seeing can't you simply end up dreaming they work the exact same way in your dreams?). These are all the confabulations of a dreaming mind. 

The clincher is the following. This is the only dream movie where 'reality' and dreams look the same. What is in the title of the movie? Inception. What is inception? Implanting an idea into someone largely by convincing them the first level of dreaming is the reality. But what if the AUDIENCE was also a victim of inception? The whole process of inception nicely parallels the process of movie making. 

Finally the top. It falls. More importantly, however, why does Cobb leave the top at the table? He's never done this before! The top is not a totem but a keepsake reminding him of his late wife. Cobb used his dream to process the guilt he had regarding his wife's suicide. Letting go of the top and going to see his children means he has also let go of his guilt and is ready to mentally devote himself fully to his wife's greatest legacy.",2019-11-29T13:59:29Z

“When I got the script of Inception, I was a bit puzzled by it,” Caine said. “And I said to [Nolan], ‘I don’t understand where the dream is.’ I said, ‘When is it the dream and when is it reality?’ He said, ‘Well, when you’re in the scene, it’s reality.’ So get that — if I’m in it, it’s reality. If I’m not in it, it’s a dream.”",2019-11-10T18:35:05Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@polite_as_fuck,"Nicholas Allingham - The greater complexity of _Inception_ is evident in the amount of dialogue that is devoted to explaining the intricacies and concept of shared dreaming. The amount of time spent explaining everything is rather high when you stop to think about it. Most films allow you to make a lot of your own inferences about what’s taking place, but not so much with this one. 

_Interstellar,_ on the other hand, is explained rather succinctly by Cooper in the tesseract at the end (along with a brief refresher on Special and General Relativity). Just my take, though. They’re two of my favorite films, so I don’t intend to diminish one or the other.",2020-06-09T08:00:43Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@ohadams8008,Well its been proven beyond any doubt now according to Nolan and Michael Cane this scene is actually a reality and he is not dreaming. Biggest proof is that Michael cane is in the scene and the totem starts to wobble at the end. it never wobbles during sleep or dream. The kids are not grown up because he chose to see them as kids. the scene was shown from his POV and not Michael Cane. Michael would have seen them as grown up children 8 years older.,2019-08-26T23:20:41Z

They made it seem like Peter Browning (Tom Berenger) was manipulating Fischer so that he would no longer trust him, and they repaired Fischer's relationship with his father by making it seem like his father had really cared about him instead of just training him to take over the company. I can explain further if you want. This is the one movie that I totally nerd out about.

XQPy88-E2zo,@jillum89,"Archer ​ ""you wake up in real life in which your memories in the dreamscape are quickly faded away and erased and your current conscious state will reconnect with the mental state before falling asleep in the first place""
I'm sure that this is true in real life. I think you're right about the real world. But movies often play by different rules - their rules - and not necessarily the rules we have in real life. We have to apply the rules of the movie to the universe of the movie when we interpret what's going on in the movie. And what you describe doesn't appear to be the nature of the movie-universe. 


Mal saw things and experienced things in her dreams ... and she was in limbo for decades too. And when she woke up, all of it was still in her. After waking, she still remembered the belief that the world isn't real - a belief that she gained in the dream. She wasn't convinced of that when she went to sleep. But she continuously believed it to be completely real years and years after.
The entire plot about the movie ... going into Fisher's mind to plant an idea that's going to stick with him ... that's also would make no sense if it was an in-universe mechanic that he was just going to wake up and just forget it all immediately.


It does appear that the in universe lore of dreaming is that it kinda sticks after waking up. Like one continued stream.


And for that reason, I wondered too ... how can one remember a phone number by heart after decades in limbo? :)",2020-02-12T11:51:42Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@theantiliberal-l5p,"Archer But, in this movie the dreams doesn't work like the drugs in the real world, in reality, of course yes dreams faded and so does the memory. But the machine that cobb used is unreal, it has the ability to connect two people consciousness. And judging from cobb's trip to the limbo, he seemed to remember everything, the points he brings up in the movie about limbo is very jumpy, the beginning of the limbo, the middle of the limbo where he planted the idea inside his wife's head, and the end of the limbo. And that's when he told ariadne his story, that was years after his trip to the limbo. The limbo isn't something like a normal dream, where you wake up and the memory fades. The point of limbo is you fell into limitless consciousness, a dream land, It's unlike any normal dream. And the effect of the device also is more than just put you into a sleeping state where you are lucid dreaming, it's a lifelike feeling, you felt every second and you can remember them after you woke up. Real life lucid dreams doesn't work like that, you can feel it when you are in it, but when you woke up you only remember points of the dream. We can't take real life science into a sci-fi movie. The device was made for military usage for them training in a life simulation. So i do think it's kind of a plothole where saito just woke up from living an old life and being able to remember the phone call.",2020-06-02T06:17:56Z

The tought process is just so trippy, it’s just not describable.

Also, before experiencing this other life I was in the void this one time. There was nothing and I was convinced that this was the real life in the void. During this time in this nothingness, I tought to myself „this can’t be it? I remember other things, I remember different objects, am I dreaming?“ 

And you try to wake up but you can’t. You stay in this void for as long as the stuff you smoked wants you to stay there. Then after what felt were days I finally started to manifest objects to interact with.

XQPy88-E2zo,@AbhishekKumar50,"Reasons why Cobb is not in a dream -
1. The Ring. Someone pointed out he's wearing a ring whilst in a dream and doesn't when he's not. He's not wearing one in the final scene. BOOM! Not a dream.
2. You clearly see the totem slowing down and about to topple. Even if the scene is cut it's understood that the totem slowed down hence it will topple!
3. Michael Cane revealed in an interview that all scenes with him in it are absolutely real. Nowhere does he appear in a dream. Source: https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/michael-caine-inception-christopher-nolan-ending-real-dream-leonardo-dicaprio-a8488286.html

XQPy88-E2zo,@bradleyrudland321,"There have been cinematic masterpieces such as Terminator 2, The Matrix, Lost Highway, Existence, Clockwork Orange, Fight Club and countless other films that are either thought provoking or visual benchmarks. Inception would have to be the one film that is succinct and cohesive, has multiple layers and is visually spectacular. I believe that there are 4 separate plots in which Nolan has perfectly seamed into one story. If you miss any part of the dialogue in this film then it will make no sense, it took me about 5 viewings to understand the concept of Cobb making Inception a reality and his battle to finally erase the memory of his wife to succeed in the one goal in his life which is to see his children again. Nolan is on the same level if not higher than visionary director/writers like Cronenberg, Kubrick, Lynch, Wakowski Brothers and Snyder.",2019-06-26T11:36:50Z

Having seen this movie in theaters four times, renting it in DVD and on Blu-Ray, and buying it on CD sountrack, I was all about this movie. All of that said, I remember NOTHING about the movie. One consolation is I get to experience new stuff like this all over again, seeing them as if I never watched them before. Lost my collection, though, so I have no means of watching it again any time soon. I don't care to watch online movies. I am quite entitled to, but I have no interest.

XQPy88-E2zo,@TheKickboxnico,"Michael Caine explained the ending of Inception

SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER

After more than eight years of debate over the ending of Inception, Michael Caine has offered some clarity on the movie’s mysterious final moments.

While speaking at a Film 4 Summer Screen showing of Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed thriller, Caine—who played the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Dom Cobb—shared some insider knowledge on whether Cobb was awake or dreaming in Inception‘s closing sequence.

“When I got the script of Inception, I was a bit puzzled by it,” Caine said. “And I said to [Nolan], ‘I don’t understand where the dream is.’ I said, ‘When is it the dream and when is it reality?’ He said, ‘Well, when you’re in the scene, it’s reality.’ So get that — if I’m in it, it’s reality. If I’m not in it, it’s a dream.”

There you have it, Inception fans. Since Caine is in the final scene, it’s reality. Case closed. The totem falls.

XQPy88-E2zo,@SuperGeronimo999,"It's a great ending, because it makes you wonder... the totem actually isn't important. It belongs to his wife, and not to him. If anyone else touches it, it doesn't work anymore. So, even if it was a dream, it would stop spinning, and you can see it become slower and almost falling towards the end. 

Now, Cobb's totem has never been revealed, but its probably his wedding ring. He always wears it, in his dreams (where his wife still exists), but not in the reality. And in the ending he doesn't wear it either.",2019-05-30T17:19:47Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@zodd1790,"@grandoldsoul4691 A Parallel Life / Awoken By A Lamp

throw away account cause this is really personal.

My last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive (note he was 325lbs I was 120lbs), while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life.

I met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter.

I had a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she [my wife] bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.

One day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but... just.. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade). I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp.

I stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany.... the lamp is not real.... the house is not real, my wife, my kids... none of that is real... the last 10 years of my life are not fucking real!

The lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspective and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, all kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain.... a fucking shit ton of pain... the first words I said were ""I'm missing teeth"" and opened my eyes. I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused.

At some point a cop scooped me up, dragged/walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused.

I was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit..

I went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision, he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says.

EDIT (24 hours after post): never though anyone would read this, I changed a line so that it no longer seems that my 2 year old daughter bore a child.

I have never seen Inception or the Star Trek episode so many have mentioned (but I will eventually)",2022-08-27T05:05:32Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T19:30:57Z

Those airports are  like little cities.  No way you gonna see grass and trees. Flying International you have to go thru long lines at customs, you just don't get off you flight, walk quickly thru customs and out a door to an eating area right there, you have to navigate a great distance to get out of the arrivals area. To me, this showed he was still dreaming. Not to mention that is Mal's spinning top, not his.

Dreams don't have time lines nor do they have time as we measure it while awake. They can merge timelines all together like a highway with 10 lanes, each having a different story or perspective and characters. In your dreams it all happens at once and can take 10-15 minutes tops. 
Once I dream my daughter as 2years old, she is currently 48, we were living in a house we lived in when she was 17yrs old, on a street I lived on when I was 15 yrs old.

In the first few scenes where Cobb and Arthur were inside saitos dream, (second dream)Cobb shot Arthur so hé can wake up in the first dream ( hé didnt go to a limbo) plus he returned  and Cobb to the real world. So the limbo thing is just and illusion, an inception an idea that Cobb and his team gave to saito when he got shot in fisher's dream so he would stay with them and not return to the real world and be see that Cobb mission is done and the arrangement is successfull.Cobb did inception to saito just like he did to mal when he convinced her she was dreaming...at the end we see Cobb trying to re convince saito that he was dreaming and the limbo is just an illusion, so he reached his gun killed cobb and killed himself to comeback to the real world. + at the end Cobb for thé first time he could see his childrens faces when he was dreaming hecould only see their backs + the if you look closely at the spinning thing at the end you can see it started to unbalance.",2019-04-11T19:39:30Z

Perfectly capturing the way dreams are so deeply personal and yet an experience shared by every single person; the confusion upon waking, the slipping away of memories, the half-remembered details, the growing realisation upon waking...

Then there's the implications; the pride and satisfaction felt by the team, Saito's promise is remembered, the stillness as Cobb walks up to immigration, the shear euphoria at ""Welcome home"" then seeing his kids and then, finally, the moment where Cobb ignores the totem, which spins... and spins....... and spins.......... and...... [credits]

Alongside a short list of films like American Beauty (Kevin Spacey ignored...), Inception is one of only a handful of films which leave you thinking at the end ""Wow"". Not because of spectacle (though it has that) but because it is ""satisfying"". A feeling like you went on a journey of importance and interest and really got to take something away from it.

I wouldn't ever want to see a sequel, it would destroy the singular beauty of Inception, but I hope another film with similar impact and thought provoking themes comes along.",2019-02-20T01:06:01Z

We should forgive people their transgressions even as we would want forgiveness and grace.  That's something we all need ( grace ) , and lots of it. Just give people some rope , okay ?  The more rope the better.  Also , there is a passage in the Holy Scriptures that says mercy triumphs over judgement .  Love people ; forgive them ; show mercy and extend grace.

They were mindblown and told me they had heart palpitations at the end because it was so anxiety producing and riveting. I thought they were silly girls.
Went in at when all the dream levels came together at the end, I was almost having an anxiety attack lol. I remember being so ridiculously immersed and invested in the film that I had a physical reaction to it. Coming out of it, I reacted exactly the same as the girls did when I stumbled across a friend of mine.

Inception has been criticized and added to meme-culture over the years because it (rightfully) became very popular, but that popularity doesn't negate the greatness of this film.

XQPy88-E2zo,@TheKickboxnico,"Michael Caine explained the ending of Inception

SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER

After more than eight years of debate over the ending of Inception, Michael Caine has offered some clarity on the movie’s mysterious final moments.

While speaking at a Film 4 Summer Screen showing of Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed thriller, Caine—who played the father of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Dom Cobb—shared some insider knowledge on whether Cobb was awake or dreaming in Inception‘s closing sequence.

“When I got the script of Inception, I was a bit puzzled by it,” Caine said. “And I said to [Nolan], ‘I don’t understand where the dream is.’ I said, ‘When is it the dream and when is it reality?’ He said, ‘Well, when you’re in the scene, it’s reality.’ So get that — if I’m in it, it’s reality. If I’m not in it, it’s a dream.”

There you have it, Inception fans. Since Caine is in the final scene, it’s reality. Case closed. The totem falls.

The first few times on such drugs where they seem to last for weeks or months and make you panic that you are stuck there forever so you should just learn to live in this new word.... I remember those. The friends you make with your ""projections"" become the closest ones of your life. When you finally try to seek sobriety, the heartbreak and loneliness that comes from having to say goodbye to them is like a part of you dying.

XQPy88-E2zo,@stevenwatchorn9816,"My favorite Nolan films (Memento, The Prestige, this one) end with a touch of ambiguity between happiness and sadness.  What I love here is how the audience is left to choose which is more important to them:  Cobb's happiness or whether it is real (and I know about the ring  cue, but there is no guarantee this holds here, especially if he is in someone else's dream... or even still in a version of limbo).  There is the crescendo of music, which sounds hopeful, as he sees his children (even if he is wondering a little if it is a dream).  Then the *same* theme is played more quietly to suggest, first, quiet happiness and contentment, and then plays on longer than might be expected, developing the idea that something *may* be a little off (with the disquieting, throbbing hum just below).  And it lets us decide whether we think that is more important or not.  I absolutely love that.

(and I keep coming back to, how did he get himself and Saito out of limbo with no kick?  Unlike every other time, it just happened... or did it?  If he convinced Saito to commit suicide with him, why not show that, and make it look instead like they just came out? into a world where *everything* turned out for the best?)",2018-09-27T15:46:53Z

i.e. break up the companies.....and what? What was the whole point of the inception....sell off the company? Break it up?

 
So to get to that inception they have to get him to believe the lawyers was hiding some secret from him....? Level 2-3 Hence the Snow scene was supposed to be the lawyers mind?

  So on level 2 the hotel scene they reveal to the subject he is in a dream from level 1...

So Copp using Mal's totem doesn't make sense.. His Totem may be his ring as many says.. But again in plane you can see his ring but not in the last scene.. see how Nolan hides Copp left hand behind the chair, then behind his daughter in the last scene, which might be an indication that his real totem was his ring...

XQPy88-E2zo,@Praise___YaH,"Guys, Here is our Savior

YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified/Pierced for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”

From the Ancient Egyptian Semitic: 
""Yad He Vav He"" is what Moshe (Moses) wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)

Ancient Egyptian Semitic Direct Translation
Yad - ""Behold The Hand""
He - ""Behold the Breath""
Vav - ""Behold The NAIL"" <— YaH’s Crucifixion
He - ""Behold the Breath""

“Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL” 

PROVES - YAH The Heavenly Father HIMSELF was Who they Crucified

That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote

Here is what they mean

YaH's Name:
(Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: ""this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations"" (Exodus 3)

YaH is The Creator of “MAN”: (Genesis 2:7)
Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's ""HAND"" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His ""BREATH"" made him a living being (Adam)

YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion for “MAN”:
Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the ""NAIL"" through YaH’s ""HAND"", in Sacrifice of Crucifixion, that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His “BREATH” brings forth life (Salvation)

How YaH arrives:
YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11, Isaiah 54, 55), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...

Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified:
YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be NAILED/PIERCED on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...

HE WAS YaH!!!

HalleluYAH translates “Praise ye YaH”

The Hebrew Book of Isaiah

Isaiah 42:8
""I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.

Isaiah 43:11
I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.

Isaiah 45:5
I am YaH, and there is none else.",2023-02-07T19:02:43Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@VelvetSkyye,"@kentatakao6863 I mean that’s wrong. Nolan’s whole point was that, to Cobb, it literally did not matter if the totem was spinning infinitely or not. To us it shouldn’t matter either, as his ring was his totem. If he doesn’t have it on, that’s what we need to know. As we can see when he hands the passport to the guard at 1:20, he does not have the ring. Therefore, couple with finally seeing his kids faces and Christopher’s character being present. This is reality, even if it weren’t, seeing his kids was enough for Cobb specifically, so he didn’t care if mal’s totem kept spinning. Seeing his kids never happened in his dream because in real life he never saw them turn around before he fled so there was nothing his subconscious could fill it with so to him, he was in reality when he saw them.

Some of you not getting that the ending is as simple “perspective” doesn’t mean Nolan was exceptionally cunning, it just means some of you are very dumb. Or at the very least are very unperceptive of things",2023-05-08T01:37:13Z

And, if I was asleep on a comfy plane, or maybe I had my mouth open when I slept, there is a good chance that someone next to me will give me a goofy smile (Arthur.)    And I've seen people on planes (or trains) wake up, look around all confused, and then immediately call someone.   All the behavior in this final scene is consistent with ""bunch of people waking up on a plane.""

Although the movie has a very straight plot, and I don't think anyone has ever corroborated my assessment, there is absolutely nothing in this scene that debunks my theory.  ;)  Thank you.",2024-02-24T15:19:48Z

i don't think seeing the kids' faces and not wearing the ring mean reality here. cobb already saw his kids' faces long time ago, before leaving or around it at some point, hence the kids here wearing same clothes in same height n weight,
his mind merely finds him worthy now, to be allowed to see the kids faces, to be worthy of no longer haunted by mal.
but he still is in the dream world. hence the kids not growing up.

He knows, And I know on first viewing, at the start of this clip. Nolan said there's a definite answer, it won't be honest storytelling if it didn't. It's just that it shouldn't matter. It's obvious to me. Whenever they woke up, they know how they got there, and transition edit is smooth. Whenever they sunk deeper, there is a brief moment of confusion on how they got there and edit is abrupt without transition. It's obvious he sank deeper. And Cobb probably knew he sank deeper. There's even a scene of Cobb asking that girl if she could remember how they ended up at that cafe when she first sank.",2025-07-20T01:43:56Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@BurninPhoenix,"@sociobiologist5141 Though her Totem did its job anyway. It truly showed if they were in a dream or reality even though it was used by Cobb. And his ring was a key factor in the movie as you told which may make it his totem as, it appeared and disappeared based on whether he was in a dream or not.   Though the spinning top was doing its job even when it was used by Cobb and he was the thief who enters others dreams. His wife wasn't a thief.  So why should she need one. So probably, it was actually his own Totem which his wife took occasionally. And even Saito uses it effectively to prove that they were in dream( in Limbo, just before old Saito kills cobb and himself).",2019-05-28T16:37:44Z

They see level 4 is Limbo so if you were already in a dream then it’d only take 3 sleeps for you to get there? Cobbs been there so he’d know if he saw his constructs again. Wouldn’t this also be a good way to convince Mal that they we or weren’t dreaming before she died? 

Alternatively, if Mal was right and she escaped while he’s still dreaming then it’s not such a bad ending cause if it’s real he gets to be with his kids finally and if it’s a dream then at some point he’s gonna wake up.

his left hand is hiden, but in every dreams and reality time we're able to see it so that we see only one thing, his ring finger. in reality he has to accept that his wife that, but in dreams he's doing everything he can to keep her alive,, so he have the ring that shows he wouldn't let her go.

Even if it doesnt seem that this is the reality, you should know that the dreams and the complexity of the mind is pure creation.""
 I also think that everyone was amazed by what they have done, I mean, the way everything changed in that mind, the levels and all the amazing paradoxes were beautiful. That scene doesnt appear here, but in the end, when Cobb realizes that the old man is Saito I just looked at a blank wall and started crying. A brilliant scene was when that father told his son ""I was dissappointed...that you tried"" and after I saw it I knew, I knew how much I would love this movie. I just cant explain why that scene especially and the one with Saito. Maybe it is because it was a big plot twist or just the way the regizor thaught about it.

All this, while at the same time wishing his 3rd degree derivative could be real to the point of going there knowing its not real. He shows surprise at having children to greet him; that feeling of a minute being decades of perception in the 3rd degree hence a loss of  being able to confirm ""reality"" as it feels to be a very old memory. I think many of us have had dreams where we realize we are dreaming and think we wake up only to find ourselves in a false reality of another dream...minutes later we awake in reality, with clarity; only minutes have passed from getting a drink of water but it felt like hours.

No one acknowledges him as he exists the airport because they are strangers that subconsciously made it into his dream. When you start a dream, you randomly wake up in a random place. Cobb woke up randomly in so called limbo. 

Nolan put the idea in your head to question whether the ending is reality or a dream. When all long it was a dream that he woke up from. He incepted the audience.


Cobbs wife in real life killed herself because she went crazy. He wasn't around to stop her because hes a workaholic. Due to work and travel he regrets not seeing his kids enough. All of those things seeped into his dreams.",2018-05-26T04:35:34Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Watermeba,"From what I understand, if the totem spins forever, then he is in someone else's dream. If it topples, he is either in reality or his own dream (since he knows the balance of his own totem). Therefore, whether that top spins forever or not, you still can't say for sure if he is in a dream or not.",2018-05-12T18:24:15Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@JazzGuitarPractice,"""Something You Once Knew"" This composition is loosely inspired by the movie ""Inception"" and Hans Zimmers ""Time"". I had recently seen the movie for my third time (totally worth it) And it, as of all Christopher Nolans work, has a very special atmosphere to it. So when i was writing this music, i was in this special feeling which gave me clues to what harmonies to use. The title is a quote from the movies ending when Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio brings Saito, Played by Ken Watanabe, back from the ""Limbo world"" and into the real world. Awesome stuff

He even mentions you have to use your own totem to know when you’re dreaming or not. He was using her totem because he found it in her safe. He was telling the story that she locked it away and he found her totem. We are all down at least one level of a dream. When we are awake in the real world we think it’s real life but in fact we are one level down in the real world. Life is but a dream.

You could see it slowly start to wobble and then just before it cuts off there's one big wobble which indicates it must've fallen 2 seconds after it cut off. If it was a dream it would've been in a perfect spin. 

Also if you think about it, these dreams they went into were created by an architect. So who would design this dream of him meeting his children and for what reason? It could not be Cobb himself or else he would know this is a dream and would've not spun the totem anyway. I think there is more than enough 'proof' or reason to believe that he did in fact return to America to see his kids.

I studied physics and quantum physics for the last 2 years, and it really helped me to understand this ending from the scientific perspective. Here is the truth. If trying to be down to earth then the wheel is clearly going to stop, just by observing its motion and apply simple physics - it's obvious. So, does this mean that he has found his true reality? Not exactly. Here is a complicated part - from quantum physics perspective there are infinite number of realities and only you subconsiously choose which of those will become consiously real for you. Simply said, true objective reality doesn't exist and never existed at all. It becomes your reality once you begin truly believing in it. You are part of simulated world, a dream. To sum up - Leo has not found reality, he just chose to be his reality that moment when he saw his kids faces.",2017-06-03T01:00:26Z

If there hadn't been the image of the spinning spin in the end, nobody would've sincerely doubted that Cobb is in his real life.
By not showing us how the spin falls, Nolan planted the thought of Cobb being in a dream into the minds of the watchers.
He literally performed an inception at the end of the movie and we all are falling for it, not getting the thought out of our mind and debating this topic.

2. The top had already been spinning for an unnaturally long time before the scene ended. 
3. Saito instantly erasing his criminal record, and having his dad there waiting to pick him up, and his old house being exactly as he left it... That seems highly suspicious and dream-like.

But the point really is that at some point you decide to 'take a leap of faith' and trust what brings you peace even if it doesn't make sense logically, I suppose.

That is what you believe, and that is perfectly fine. The ending was intentionally cut like that so it keeps ambiguity to the viewer. But there is no right or wrong way to the ending because no one knows.",2017-01-03T02:08:53Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@nattyofastora,"*****
No. It's not. Christopher Nolan himself has stated that he left the ending to be open to interpretation on whether Cobb is dreaming or not. And we see the totem wobble but never fall over and it still could possibly regain balance but we never see that because that is the way Chris Nolan shot it. But as I said before there is no right or wrong with this ending, so you can believe that he is not dreaming and that is perfectly fine. But it isn't wrong to believe that he is still dreaming, and that is what makes this ending so good and unique because it doesn't give the audience a straight answer. You need to accept that.",2017-01-03T03:05:59Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@allbottledup9513,"Because at other points in the movie, his top has faltered but continued to spin anyways, meaning he's dreaming. The top has to actually topple to be reality, not just falter. Besides, the ends not about whether or not it's real. Cob spins to see if it's a dream but when he sees his kids faces, he doesn't care if it's a dream or reality. He spent what felt like over fifty years trying to get back to them, and in the end he just wanted to be happy and see them again. Even though it's supposed to be left up to the viewer to choose whether or not he's still dreaming, it's almost one hundred percent likely as everyone is surprised and he's not wearing his wedding ring. Though it's not pointed out in the film, the Devils in the detail: He always wore his ring when dreaming but never in reality. In the end, he's not wearing his ring. On top of this, he has no way of knowing that everyone would he surprised that's he's back. That is their actual reactions, including Caito's. He is awake.",2016-08-29T04:25:50Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@_ANGST,"It is ambiguous because when he focuses on his children and, as a result, fully loses himself in this possible dream-part of his or someone's brain, he loses the bound to his token making himself dropping the evidence of checking it out forever. If he would turn around and take this token, he could never be sure if it was still the same token extracted out of his secret part of memory, or if it became subjected to the dreamworld. His father could touch it before he would check it out again, or maybe this touch isn't even needed to lose the bound to it, but just the change of perception, so DiCaprio fucked himself up because he didn't care at this moment.

Hence, the token losing its spin could symbolize either DiCaprio being in reality, or DiCaprio being in a dream world and slowly losing his power / perception over his token.",2016-10-25T09:29:53Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@IMindiffernt,"Yes, when he woke up on the beach he was in Limbo with Saito. We don't really know exactly how he found him other than he is in a dream so he can manipulate the world however he wants and they were the only two people in the world with an actual conscience (or sub-conscience) so they would be naturally drawn to each other. When Cob finds him, he convinces him to ""come back"" with him to reality. Saito then reaches for a gun and they wake up. This implies that they used the gun to kill themselves, supposedly returning to the real world.",2016-07-24T09:14:53Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@IMindiffernt,"Ah yes they didn't for the exact same reason Saito didn't kill himself before Cob showed up at the end of the film. They didn't know they were in limbo. You have to remember the line where Cob explains that dreams seem real while they are in them, and this effect is even more prevalent while in limbo to the point that its almost impossible to separate dream from reality. Remember when Cob found that house while he was in limbo and put the spinning top in the safe? That was how he convinced her they were in limbo, because to her, a spinning top represents a dream.",2016-07-25T04:39:00Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@Jakeykeywheels17,Mick Jimmy but they were building cities with their minds.... they thought that was real?,2016-07-25T06:56:22Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@IMindiffernt,"Yes exactly. Remember we, as the viewer, know that they were dreaming, but they thought building and destroying cities was just part of their reality. It all comes back to when Cob says that dreams seem like reality while we are in them, but its not until after we wake up that we realize how absurd they actually are. Which I've always thought was brilliant because so much of the film hinges on that 10 second explanation.",2016-07-25T08:02:38Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@IMindiffernt,"They weren't in limbo though. I don't think its ever explained exactly how they know they are dreaming in those scenes, but I think its safe to assume that they were aware because they just know what to expect, or maybe something about the machine allows them to be cognizant of the fact that they are dreaming.

- no ring (have one in dreams as he dreams of his nuclear family complete)

- totem was there to confuse people; the concept of the totem is dependent on its owner:

It has been made clear that if you utilize your own totem; it will reveal to you if you're living in someone else's dream - that's it; it does not tell you if you're in reality and hence that theory is dismissed for that reason and due to the fact, that it's simply not his totem.",2016-06-16T19:11:57Z

But if Fischer knows that these dream corporate raiders exist (and he does - his mind was trained with specific resistance against any dream raiders), then shouldn't he interpret all of this as just some attempt to hijack his dreams? So he inexplicably falls asleep, and all the people he's sitting next to are involved in his dream.

The obvious thing is that the dreams can be compare to movies (the different sets of environnement, the team they put together to build the dream...). From there i can tell it doesn't stop spinning, cause we don't see it stops, a movie like a dream cease to exist once it's done and at the end of the movie it's still spinning. Plus Cobb is not looking at it in the end, if he doesn't see it nothing can tell him if he's in a dream or not. But us as we watch the film it can tell us if we're in a dream aka movie or not. So i'd say that the movie itself has to be consider as the first layer of dream and as viewers we are the ones travelling throught all those dreams aka movies.",2016-02-07T14:38:44Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Dante02d12,"So, I just wanted to throw my 2 cents about the ""wedding ring theory"" when I saw that comment, so here I go ^^ (and sorry if what I'll say was already said, I didn't bother to read all the comments).
Assuming the wedding ring is actually Cobb's totem, *why would he use the spinning top instead during the whole film?* If his wearing the ring is a totem, Cobb doesn't need to do anything to understand he's dreaming or not (as he would just feel the weight around his finger if he's in a dream).
What about Mal, by the way? Why would _she_ use the top in the first place? Why doesn't she use her wedding ring as well? The ring is much more practical.


Because of that, this theory doesn't hold up. If the wedding ring is shown only during dreams sequence, that's more likely because it's the symbol of Cobb's dependance to his wife. He only lets her go in the end.


Inception's end is *meant to be open.* Anyone suggesting the end is clear and has a definite answer... *is plain wrong.* There is no true answer. Is Cobb in the reality in the end? Cobb himself doesn't care (which is why he doesn't check the top in the end).

XQPy88-E2zo,@Dante02d12,"@xarachne8473 Yeah, you'll admit that it's kind of a stretch, don't you think? ^^

XQPy88-E2zo,@xarachne8473,@Dante02d12 so you think Cobb would just let someone trick him?,2019-05-20T16:41:08Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@Dante02d12,"@xarachne8473 I'm saying nothing in the movie shows Cobb as a paranoiac, which is why I call it a stretch (meaning it's *not impossible, but not supported by anything* but people's beliefs).
On the contrary, the movie keeps showing that Cobb uses the top as a totem, and once again, Nolan himself said there was no clear answer as the point was that reality is subjective.


There's also another obvious point I forgot to mention.
According to the theory, if Cobb wears the ring, he's in a dream, right?
*But in the flashbacks that happen in the reality, he does wear his ring.* Hence, the totem simply wouldn't work (since back then he wears the ring both in reality and in dreams, so it's pointless xD).
Hence, his wedding ring was not his totem back then. Hence, he had something else as a totem. so now... why would he change his totem to his wedding ring?
Now I know what you'll say: ""okay, the ring was not his totem back then but he started to use it as a totem after Mal's death.""
Not impossible, but again, let's be real, it's a stretch. Nothing supports that idea.


That's the problem with this theory (as with many theories): *most of it is a stretch based only on the belief of the one who started it and the others who follow.*


If we stick to facts (hence: what the movie shows and what the director said): *the movie is intended to be open, so its having an answer would destroy that very idea.*

My point is, there are no such rules as ""you don't know how you got to a place."" In fact, *there are no rules **_at all_** when we're talking about dreams.* Dreams are imaginary by their very nature. You can imagine you pop up to a place, or you can imagine the whole way...",2019-05-28T07:22:23Z

If that plane scene was Cobb's dream then while coming out of the limbo he should have ended up in the reality and not in yet another dream(the plane).,2020-06-14T20:11:26Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Dante02d12,"@sir-dolphino He didn't say the _word._ But that's still what he did say for anyone who knows how to use a brain.
Caine didn't know what scene was reality and what wasn't. Nolan told him that so that he *considers* his scenes are his reality. Again,  the point was that reality is subjective.

https://www.gamesradar.com/inception-ending-christopher-nolan-interview-leonardo-dicaprio-michael-caine/#:~:text=Christopher%20Nolan%3A%20the%20answer%20doesn't%20matter&text=%22The%20way%20the%20end%20of,levels%20of%20reality%20are%20valid.%E2%80%9D

I quote : ""[Cobb] was in *his own subjective reality.* He didn’t really care anymore, and that makes a statement: perhaps, all levels of reality are valid.""

Nolan answered to Caine in a way that he CONSIDERS his scenes are reality. To further the point that reality is subjective. What is real for Caine's character may not be real for other characters... *and is absolutely not objective reality.*

Next time you call someone an annoyance, do your homework first.

I'll add that the point of subjective reality is obvious when you watch the movie. I'm still baffled at the number of people who don't understand the point of an OPEN ending: it means there is no objective answer, because if there is, it's not open anymore. It doesn't mean we can't discuss it, on the contrary, that's the point. But trying to force your opinion on others is just toxic as fuck.",2021-02-10T07:53:01Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Dante02d12,"@TheNightman. Your arrogance only shows your sheer lack of braincells and your inability to give arguments.

The confirmation you're talking about is sheer wrong. Nolan never said Cobb was in reality, he answered to Caine by telling him ""when you're in the scene, this is YOUR reality"". That's been interpreted as ""whenever Caine is in a scene, this is reality"", which is literally not what Nolan said.

The whole POINT of Inception is to say that reality is subjective. Saying that there's an objective reality in the movie is misunderstanding the whole story.
And THAT'S what makes YOUR opinion irrelevant.

Next time you talk down to me, make sure you're intelligent enough to understand a movie you pretend to be a fan of.

""I feel that over time, we started to view reality as the poor cousin to our dreams, in a sense….I want to make the case to you that our dreams, our virtual realities, these abstractions that we enjoy and surround ourselves with - they are subsets of reality.""

""The way the end of that film worked, Leonardo DiCaprio’s character Cobb — he was off with his kids, he was in his own subjective reality. He didn’t really care anymore, and that makes a statement: perhaps, all levels of reality are valid. The camera moves over the spinning top just before it appears to be wobbling, it was cut to black.

""I skip out of the back of the theater before people catch me, and there’s a very, very strong reaction from the audience: usually a bit of a groan. The point is, objectively, it matters to the audience in absolute terms: even though when I’m watching, it’s fiction, a sort of virtual reality. But the question of whether that’s a  dream or whether it’s real is the question I’ve been asked most about any of the films I’ve made. It matters to people because that’s the point about reality.

His wife died because of that crazy thought, so he realised ( and that has to be seen on an emotional level ) in the moment he saw the faces of his kids ( first time in the movie ), that it doesn't matter. His emotions overcame his rational thinking. Atleast thats what nolan wants to tell us with the scene. Look at his facial expression when he saw the faces of his kids.

XQPy88-E2zo,@Nuurix,"dekapitatorr Its not about it being a dream or anthing. He doesn't care if it is a dream or not thats the point. Not saying he KNOWS its a dream and he decided to live it. Im saying he doesn't know it (metaphor: he didn't look at the result), because he doesn't care about it he only cares to be with his children again and seeing their faces again ( metaphor: After looking at the totem, he looks back at his childs and never looks back). You have to look at this scene metaphorically. The totem stands for the infinite question; Is this reality? ( thats why the totem spins infitly when its not, because realising your current reality is not real, means you will always turn in a circle asking that question, because that question can never be answererd ). The children stand for his children, but also metaphorically for all of his desires in his life ( family etc. ). The faces stand for the emotional aspect of that ( cobb says he cant even remember the faces anymore, and thats the most devastating part of his sad relationship to his family). You have to realise, that he didn't say "" this is a dreamworld and I dont care if it is fake, I will live this as my reality"". What he said with that scene is ""I don't know if this is reality, it mgiht be it might not be, but in the end it does not matter what matters is the love to my children and my desire to be free from that question of reality ( thats why he walks away from the totem ). This last scene is the epitome of movie endings imo, because it does not only give the question ( is this real ? ), it right away gives the answer to it within seconds ( Does not matter, all that matters are my children and I better not care about the result of that totem ) . That is beautifully presented in a metaphorical sense so people can figure their own ending out of this. My interpretation is not giving the answer to the whole debate about the reality, I just point out the intention of Christopher Nolan with this scene. A life lession he wanted to convey to the audience. Thats what he always does with his movies and thats why I believe he is a living legend on this planet. A true genius and I am more excited for the next movie of his, than anything else. A true masterpiece this movie and especially the ending.",2016-04-24T23:15:57Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@dimonai01,"Ok then why not just run to his kids from the start, if all he cared about was being loved? The point of the ending is that his kids all along were his anchor to reality. if you hadn't noticed throughout the movie he couldn't bare to look at his kid's face. we can only speculate what he was seeing but it probably wasn't their true face(he said it himself). his kid's were his totems. noticed how he's the only one who knows what they look like? even the audience doesn't know, why is that (cough totem cough)? Cobb was lost and basically had no real sense of what was real or not throughout the movie, but his kid's, that he knew for sure. the spin top was not his totem, it was his wife's, the ending was not the first time in the movie that he didn't wait for the spin top to finish spinning.

 the ending is not as ambiguous as everyone wants it to be, if you base you assessment solely on that final scene and ignore everything that happened throughout the movie then of course it will seem like a 50/50 whether he's dreaming or not, but there is enough evidence throughout the movie that strongly hints that he's not dreaming compared to absolutely zero that he's dreaming (seriously name 1 legit piece of evidence that isn't 100% speculation?). the toppling sound at the end was just the icing on the cake to relieve any doubts you may have about the ending and also so that you may look at the movie differently next time around. just like the prestige, you'll catch a lot of clues that were right in your face once you saw the ending making the movie still enjoyable after multiple viewings.  again if all he cared about was the love of his kids, not reality, then the whole movie was a waste of time.",2017-02-02T08:06:04Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@franciscodiaz3028,chabosmulm I totally agree with you and I also believe it's about perception. this movie asked us how do we perceive the current moment we are at the time. then again time and perception are all relative to person in question.,2017-03-17T15:19:55Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@dimonai01,"no they have not explicity said w/e bullshit you just wrote (provide a link). if Cobb truly did not care whether he was dreaming or not then 1) this whole movie was a waste of fucking time  2) his wife would have died for absolutely nothing, and 3) this would be one of the worst scripts ever written.  you all are looking for greater meaning in an ending that wasn't made to be that complicated. there is no evidence that cobb is still dreaming while there is plenty that he isn't anymore, yet you're still looking for that ambiguous philosophical ending that isn't there. tell me did the spin top ever make a toppling sound during the movie when it was spinning for ever? no it was a perfect spin, no sound ever. but again the spin top wasn't his totem which is what is confusing all you people, it was his wife's!!!",2017-03-17T17:39:42Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@naes0706,"john doe I agree with you sorta but the audience are the true marks of inception. We are left with the ""idea"" whether he made it out or not. It was meant to be open ended",2017-04-02T06:49:27Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@naes0706,john doe And there are clues that points to Cobb still dreaming but it doesn't matter though. That is the purpose of the film.,2017-04-02T06:51:26Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@dimonai01,"no there are literally no clue in the movie that he is still dreaming, please name one? people keep saying that but can't name a single legitimate clue. again this open ended ending that everyone illogically clings too is not based on facts and would literally make this movie a complete waste of time. Christopher Nolan is too good of a writer/producer/director to make rubbish like that. none of his movies have ever had an open ended ending that would make everything that happened in the movie irrelevant, that's bad writing. hell i can't think of a decent movie that has an open ended ending that made everything irrelevant. there is nothing wrong with an ambiguous ending, the problem is that the ambiguity in this movie that everyone seems hung up on would again make everything that happened IRRELEVANT. if you want to see what a truly perfectly executed ambiguous ending looks like, watch the 1982 movie ""the thing"", now that's a truly ambiguous ending that can go either way and doesn't take away from everything you saw throughout the movie. Nolan's movies aren't about the ending, they're about seeing if you payed attention throughout the movie. memento, the prestige, the dark knight,  interstellar, etcs.. the ending are always a conclusion to big and small events that you may have missed but were right in front of you the whole time, they then become a lot more noticeable the next time you watch the movie.",2017-04-03T02:53:01Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@naes0706,"john doe The kids are the clue. Watch the beginning of inception then the ending only to see what I'm talking about. Watch what they are doing and listen to what they say. I've never seen ""the thing"" from 82 but thanks, I'll check it out.",2017-04-03T03:05:32Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Iguana93,"Very nicely said. Firstly, I think the whole ""it doesn't matter if it's reality as long as you're happy"" is shaky at best. It sounds poetic and kind of nice, but I don't think the idea of being stuck in you head, living essentialy in the confines of what your own brain can think of, is nice at all. You have to be pretty confident that the world around you is ""real"" to feel your life has any meaning. The idea which Cobb gave his wife was stronger than it was supposed to be, but that doesn't mean Cobb didn't have that same idea in himself already. He just wanted to get back to his kids. If he could stay happy in some construct of his head, it would be fake and his kids would still be orphaned, which sucks and really is an equivalent of ""if you drink yourself to stupor or drug yourself, you'll be happy and won't mind that your kids are in a different country"". But all this aside, as you said, the simple fact that he could see their faces meant they were real, and if that wasn't enough, the wobble of the spinning top right before the cut couldn't be more obvious and definite. It must have fallen a second after the cut. It baffles me how anyone can not see that.",2017-04-04T15:55:18Z

First of all the Totem: The totem used by cobb belonged to his wife, thus only she should know what it's function is otherwise it loses its function. If you look carefully in the movie, everytime Cobbs is dreaming, he wears his marriage-ring. In real life he does not. I'd say thats a good sign and maybe his ""real"" totem. Second of all: The KIDS. Cobb clearly said that he can only dream because of MEMORIES. And in those memories he could never see the face of his kids one last time (in that situation where they are playing on the grass). So he couldn't be dreaming in order to see their faces like in the end of the movie. And like I said, Mal's totem was a perfect distraction for us viewers to keep debating. Cobb found the (not racist don't know his name) asian guy in his limbo - but because cobb entered the limbo later, he appeared younger and the asian guy so extreme old because so much time passes in limbo where it's shorter on the upper layers. Then they reminded themselves of beeing in a dream after forgetting everything due to entering limbo. Then they killed themselves and woke up in the plane. So dudes. THE END IS REAL :)))",2015-10-08T11:52:55Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@HaoSci,So you're not telling us if it's a dream or not. Damn you!,2015-10-05T04:39:12Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@alexkunst1344,"Seeing that this all was a dream is so simple. Just look at that fact: Nolan is a director that always goes into great detail describing characters, even the characters that aren't ""real"" main characters. Just think about Alfred, two Face, the Joker, Jim Gordan and all the others in the TDK trilogy or Murphy and Brand and Romilly in Interstellar . Now, in this movie, all characters except for Cob and Mal are described incredibly shallow, something that Nolan would never do. I mean, those characters don't even have last names, they are just ""Saito"" and ""Ariadne"" and ""Arthur"" and so on. This is, because the entire movie was a dream and all the other persons therefore are projections of Cobs subconscious only, and projections are always very shallow. There is about 10 more hints that this is a dream, just take the time and watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ginQNMiRu2w , it is really really worth watching.",2015-10-04T12:54:16Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@alexkunst1344,"I think that everyone who likes this movie should watch the video ""Inception and Philosophy"" by Kyle Johnson. Because only through this video, the pure genius of the movie is revealed. 
Everyone is talking about how the top is spinning and that it might fall or might keep spinning. But the totem is no use at all to tell Cob if he is in reality or in a dream. This is because of the idea of a totem. Every totem doesnt behave normal in the real world. Take, for example, Arthurs totem. It is a prepared dice that will always show the number 5 when you roll it. If Arthur now goes into another persons dream, this persons dream will apply the normal laws of physics, because thats how the real world works. So in a dream, the number will be random, when Arthur roles the dice, because the dreamer doesnt know that Arthurs dice is prepared. That way Arthur knows if he is in a dream or not.
Now, with Cobs totem it is the opposite. If you spin a top in the real world, it will fall down. So if Cob is in someones dream and he spins the top, 99% of the time the top will fall down ANYWAY because it is that way in reality, so the dreamer will make it happen in his dream anyway. That means, that Cob could still be in anyones dream if the top falls down or if the top keeps spinning, it just doesnt matter. Because if it keeps spinning, he most definatly is in a dream because in the real world the top would fall and if the top falls down he could still be in a dream because the subconscious of the dreamer thinks that that is what would happen in the real world.
The pure genius in this scene now is the deception by Christopher Nolan. He draws the attention of the audience to the spinning top and wants them to figure out if it will fall or not. But the most important part of the movie is the conversation that Cob has with his son in the background: Cob asks ""What were you doing"" and his son replies ""We were building a house on a cliff"". 
Throughout the whole movie we have seen, that the subconscious works it way through in the dream. The best example for this is the train that suddenly rolls down the street in the first dream. It is a subconscious element from Cobs Memory of his and Mals time in the limbo when they laid down on the train tracks and let themselves get killed by the train. 
 So now his son tells Cob that they have been ""building a house on a cliff"". And building a house on a cliff is exactly what Saito had been doing in his Limbo. He was living in this Huge Japanese Mansion by the sea. So this means, that Cob is still in a dream. Because prior to waking up on the airplane, Cob was in the Limbo. But if you die in the Limbo, you go one layer up. We know this, because when Ariadne and Fischer jump from the building in the limbo they wake up back in Eams dream of the snow Fortress. So when Cob dies in the limbo, he cant wake up in ""reality"", in the airplane. When he shoots himself with the gun in Saitos Limbo, he goes up one dream layer to the snow Fortress. But this layer is empty now, since Fischer has opened the safe and thus finished the inception and everyone left the dream through the kick. So now Cob fills this drean with his own expectations, thus making it his own dream. Since he expects to wake up on the airplane in the real world again, he wakes up in the airplane, but its not the real world, it is still the snow fortress dream.
That way, this very sentence in the ending tells you that the entire movie, even the ""reality"" of Cob flying in the plane and now coming home to see his children is still a dream, because Cobs subconscious fills the dream with the information of building houses on a cliff, which Cob has experienced before when he was in Saitos limbo. But whether he knows if its a dream or not, Cob does not care anymore and accepts this dream as his reality. This is shown through his kids. In the dream where Mal told Cob to look at his kids faces, he refuses to do so because he is afraid that, if he will do so, he will want to stay in this dream and not come back to reality. Now, even if Cob knows that he is in a dream because of his sons response, he still plays with his children and accepts this dream to be his reality. He had struggled to do so before: just remember the scene where his father in law, the professor, tells him ""come back to reality"" when he visits him at the university. This is his subconscious telling Cob to wake up, and he is torn between finally waking up to the real real world and keeping on dreaming, but ultimately, in this scene, he chooses, whether consciously or subconsciously, to keep on dreaming.",2015-10-04T12:36:28Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@hastobe303,"+Ty Garner 
If this is the case, he's still asleep in his home and Mal is probably awake in the real world. Seeing as they killed themselves by train while in limbo, they only jumped one level up. Therefore Cobb is still dreaming the dream he shared with Mal, and Mal is either one level up or she killed herself enough times to wake up.
In other words, if this is the case nothing in the movie actually happened. 
Also, the spinning top feels different in the dream world than it does in the real world. So it has two qualities: perpetual spinning and different ""feel"" (not sure if it's loaded, like the die, or what's the matter with it). 
However, the top belonged to Mal, and therefore Mal alone can know the true feel of the top. 

This is not THE correct explanation, though. There are so many interpretations to this ending and Nolan hasn't really come out with any information on what really happens. So unless you are Chris Nolan or you've extracted this information from Chris Nolan's subconscious, you really are in no position to say what is and what's not. All you have is a hypothesis. It could also be argued that Cobb died in all the other dream levels due to not waking up in various dangerous situations, thus waking up when he dies in limbo.

Furthermore, I wouldn't really recommend Kyle Johnson's lecture. He has some good ideas but it was really hard to focus on the film analysis because of his intense shouting and screaming throughout.",2016-02-26T14:10:02Z

Cobb knew this but didn't want to accept the fact and that's why she kept showing up, it was part of his sub-conscious telling him the truth about the whole situation and trying to set him free from this dream.

XQPy88-E2zo,@lastuchiha007,"Aavione Howard You do not know whether it's a dream or not. It could be or could not depending on what you think and interpret. Some people say that because Cobb woke up and was with his family, that he finally got home and it is reality, like with the totem wobbling. But other evidence points that the ending is a dream, an in my opinion it is a dream. After Cobb wakes up everything happens too fast, and no dialogue is made with the other characters. No sleeping equipment is found. Lastly, when he meets his kids, the son says ""I'm making a house on a cliff."" This is a reference to Saito, who lived in a house on a cliff in his Limbo. If the kid mentions this, odds are it is not a coincidence, and therefore the ending is a dream. Other evidence shows that the entire movie is a dream, which makes more sense than everything else that's being said.",2015-08-07T00:50:21Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@AYZEEMAN,"Aavione Howard The idea is to make you wonder whether at the end he is dreaming or not. There are many theories about the film, all could be correct or false. 1. The whole film is a dream, similar conversations keep happening with different people suggesting that it is all a dream, for example both Mal and Saito talk about a leap of faith. 2. The inception is not what we think it is, it is actually Saito incepting Cobb, Saito wants this company destroyed so the only way to do that is to get Cobb to do a job for him, Saito plants the idea in Cobb's mind by using his relationship with his wife and his family, by making him believe he can get back to his family, when really he is just going to leave him in limbo. 3. He is dreaming at the end. 4. He isn't dreaming at the end. Personally I think number 4 is correct, we hear a lot about totems throughout the film, but never about Cobb's totem, the table top spinner is his wife's totem. Upon looking back at the film everytime he is dreaming he is wearing his wedding ring, at the end he is not wearing his wedding ring (as seen at airport security). So he is not dreaming at the end. I believe his wedding ring is his totem.",2015-08-08T00:45:46Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@LightBrand,"How is it that a no-ending cop-out is been seen as intellectual and deep in today's storytelling rather than a shortcoming in writing where the creator don't have to come up with any answers for the complex (and often intriguing questions) he/she raised?

Because people are clearly saying Nolan had answers, but just intentionally didn't want to share it right? Not because he himself have no clue how he wanted to tackle the problems.

For all you ""deep"" viewers that say the ending was deliberately done by Nolan to show Cobb no longer cares if he's in a dream or not, so whether the top falls over makes no difference, therefore Nolan cutting away early is justified. Even though we all know had the movie continued for 2 more minutes, Cobb would have entered the house with the kids, and he'll see the top on the table. He'll have one expression if it tipped over, he'll have another if it kept spinning...

If Nolan truly wanted to show Cobb stopped caring, he could have had DiCaprio toss the top into the trashcan on his way out the airport. Wouldn't that still leave whether he's in a dream ambiguous, but he/we no longer cares? That's giving answer yet keeps the ending ambiguous (but it no longer matters).

Makes me wonder why the Soprano ending caused such an outcry.",2015-07-08T00:39:55Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@3sweetsugarhoney3,"As someone who's watched Shutter Island and Inception for the first time both in the last 20 days or so, and someone whose favorite movie is The Prestige just like it is for you, I couldn't disagree more. Shutter Island was quite a disappointment to me, its plot twist being very predictable (so predictable, actually, that I thought there would obviously be a second plot twist that would be the real deal, but no, that never happened). Inception doesn't really have a plot twist, from the very beginning (or as soon as you understand what the movie is about) you consider the possibility that what you're watching could be also a dream, and indeed, at the end the possibility is still open.

 What makes it great is the amount of different interpretations you could get out of it, which goes way beyond the ""was it a dream/wasn't it"" discussion. Are other characters projections of Cobb's mind, representing other people in his life? Was Mal trying to go back to limbo and Cobb trying to save her, or was she the one trying to save him, and in the end killed herself to go up another level, noticing they still weren't in the real world, something Cobb refused to acknowledge? Is Saíto just Cobb's projection, and saving him from limbo is the excuse to save himself? And is the complicated father-son relationship between Fischer and his father just an excuse for Cobb to deal with his own guilt for abandoning his kids? Is Cobb playing an inception on himself? Is someone else implanting an idea in him? There's a world of possibilities, plus many visual and plot metaphors (something that's also very present in The Prestige) and the emotional conflict in the character. Those are things you won't find in Shutter Island. Shutter Island ends, and that's it, you get your ""unexpected"" ending and there's barely any place for discussion about it. But, of course, it depends on what kind of viewer you are. If you are one of those people who want certainty and don't enjoy having doubts about the story and what you've seen, you'll hate Inception, or take it in the most simple way possible (by the end he's back in the real world with his kids, the dream is over, everyone's happy, lalala), and you'll feel that Shutter Island is better because its only possible ending seems more complex and tragic than a happy ever after. But if you don't mind a story that is open to the viewer's interpretation, I don't see how you could prefer Shutter Island over Inception.",2017-02-28T22:45:03Z

If that was the case the whole movie would fall apart. But that's simply not the case because Every actions made by Projection of Mal were negative like shooting Arthur. If she was trying to incept Cobb, she would have attempted positive measures- Hence they were all Cobb's projection depending on how she was before she took her life. In short, Fischer's dream served as primary host, Mal was just Cobb's projection, Cobb's admitted that it was his fault for Mals demise, but redeemed himself of it so that he can peacefully join his family....",2017-09-06T17:46:36Z

his left hand is hiden, but in every dreams and reality time we're able to see it so that we see only one thing, his ring finger. in reality he has to accept that his wife that, but in dreams he's doing everything he can to keep her alive,, so he have the ring that shows he wouldn't let her go.

In Nolan's story Cobb creates the perfect dream layer, wherein his subconcious can't attack it. This is what we see in the last scene and the proof can be found in Nolan's extended script, which you can purchase. 

Moreover, and a point from my own observations, Cobb and Miles suddenly appear from the airport straight to his house in the last scene. ""In a dream you know where you are but not how you got there"" or whatever the quote is, said by Cobb to Ariadne, when he has her hooked up to the machine for the first time. I also think this is a hint to it still being a dream, as Nolan had to cut the details from the final script but still wanted us to know. ",2015-05-20T02:48:08Z

It's SO SIMPLE; you can hear the top wobbling as if it's about to stop spinning which when in a dream, it spins perfectly in place without a slight wobble. BUT that's not it. The true answer lies in his kids. Remember him saying no ""matter how hard he tries to recreate that last moment he left them, he can NEVER recreate their FACES"" and here you can clearly see them. Their faces, their smile, their life. I like how the director left it for us us to have fun with it. Kinda like choose your own ending type game but it took me watching this movie over 20 times to figure it out. (Not only because it's my favorite story/book/movie in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE! but because I had to solve it one way or another.) It's SIMPLE.

XQPy88-E2zo,@RoySherfan,"I've posted this on another Inception vid but I'll repost it here:

Remember this bit in the Cafe scene between Cobb and Ariadne:

Cobb: (to Ariadne) Let me ask you a question, you never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you? You always end up right in the middle of what is going on.
Ariadne: I guess... yeah.
Cobb: So how did we end up here?
Ariadne: We just came from the... ah... (She looks stumped. She could not remember how they got to the cafe).
Cobb: Think about it, Ariadne. How did you get here? Where are you right now?
Ariadne: (a sense of revelation grabs her as she looks at Cobb): ... We're dreaming?
Cobb: You're actually in the middle of the workshop right now, sleeping. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.


Now... back to the end of Inception

Question: Did Cobb remember the beginning of his ""dream""?
Answer: Yes, he woke up in the plane seat.
Consequence: If he remembers the start then there is continuity from his last point of consciousness. He WAS dreaming. He WAKES UP in the seat. It makes sense. There is temporal continuity.

Question: How did Cobb end up at his children's place?
Answer: He METHODICALLY entered the United States of America - performed mundane actions such as filling out immigration forms and presenting his passport to the customs officials. He walked through the gates at the final checkpoint and met his friend and they both made their way to the house. All the while, Cobb is looking around rechecking himself and his surroundings.
Consequence: The methodical nature of reality is you can't teleport from one location to another. Moving from the airport to the house requires a long arduous process. Each moment of this arduous process is reinforcing to Cobb that this is in fact real.

I believe this is a very strong cue that is designed to show the audience that, well, that he is NOT dreaming. The fact that he is in the process of making his way methodically from the airport to the house is a strong case to it being reality.


Other points: The Totem
A totem is an object that is used to allow the dreamer to check if they are actually in someone elses dream world. If the dreamer is the architect then the totem will feel correct. The totem only works if they are in someone elses dream world.

From this:

1. If Cobb is dreaming in someone elses dream then his Totem will feel off.
2. If Cobb is dreaming in someone elses dream then that architect will have to know what Cobb's place with their kids looks and feels like.
3. If Cobb is dreaming in someone elses dream world then all the people in it are a part of his subconscious - but if Cobb is the architect then none of the people in it are part of his subconscious.

Thus, the fact that he is in his house (impossible for another architect to fake) and the fact that he has continuity from the point he wakes up to the point he meets his children build a strong case that this is, in fact, reality.

The only thing left ambiguous at this point is whether the totem appears off to him... and obviously Nolan doesn't give us the luxury of knowing that. Hence.... we are here talking about it. Yeah... that Nolan guy. Props to him!",2015-03-13T22:56:39Z

When Cobb has to “wake” again in Limbo, his mind is muddled just like old man Saito’s brain. Through Saito’s memory of Cobb’s totem and some shared dialogue that included key trigger phrases – “Leap of faith,” “Old man full of regret, waiting to die alone,” etc. – Cobb and Saito are able to remember the meaningful conversations they had and that there is a reality they existed in before Limbo, where both of them had deep desires still waiting to be fulfilled (Cobb and his kids, Saito and his business). Once they remember that limbo is limbo,  they are able to wake themselves up (likely with a gunshot to the head).",2015-03-21T09:40:44Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@TheWambo333,"I'm sorry but I don't think the wedding ring is a totem. Why?

He doesn't even notice it a single time. It's just a nonrelevant detail produced by his subconscious, like all those random people in the city, you can't even remember but are somehow produced by your mind.
In every of Cobb's dreams, his wife is alive. Result: subconscious produces the wedding ring automatically.
If he would dream of her being dead, the ring wouldn't be there neither but as the movie told us, he can't do that anymore.

So what is Cobb's totem? Well I think he has two of them.

The first one is his wife being alive. Like I said before she is alive in every single dream and only there.
The second totem is the fact he can't or don't want to see his children's faces while he is dreaming a 'lie'.
He only can accept to see them at the top, the reality.

Now look at the final scene, his wife is finally gone and he is able see his children, both things that would never have happened in a dream. Not exactly the way the original (physical) totems work but a personal indicator for him to define a dream.
The spinning top is also a useless totem and really a symbol/keepsake for his wife (as it belonged to her). He learns to ignore it in order to go back to reality just like he did with his wife in the deepest level.

So it doesn't matter if it falls or not, he ignoring it and then look at his children (reality) instead is the important thing.

XQPy88-E2zo,@michaeldecker4341,"I just watched inception again with fresh eyes, and here are some thoughts. 

Life is a journey of many dimensions, a battle of many layers, within your own mind.  

Reality is subjective, its not where the spinner stops spinning, your ideal reality is the 
one you arrive at when you overcome the paradigms and programs that drag you down.  

This fight, or as in the movie, this 'seemingly improbable' flight, is the battle.

The deeper you go and the more layers you peel off and stare down, the faster your progress time will go, as
represented by the speed of time the more dreams then went within the dreams.   

Cobb's wife represented guilt.  Guilt wrapped in a beautiful layer, with the strongest emotions attached like love, 
the shared creation of children, and the guilt that his wanting to control her contributed to her decision to end her life. 

And that's just one emotion, wrapped up in so many layers, seemingly impossible to break all combinations.  

But that's what we all have to face to then channel the supreme creative force into our lives.  You don't have to
overcome it all at once, but you have to surrender to this ultimate battle and start the war.  

Limbo is what happens when you give up in the middle of the battle.  You get lost in whatever world you currently 
chose to die and slowly decay and who knows how long it will take to wake up. 

This movie is Cobb's limbo.  He was lost, he had given up to the temptation of Guilt's wrath many times.  

When Cobb woke up on the plane that look on his face is, wow, I can't believe I made it and how much I 
went through to let that guilt go.  

The banishment of USA just meant Cobb wouldn't allow himself to go back because of guilt.  Once the 
opportunity offered itself and he was ready for the challenge, he took it. 

I think what happens in this movie all happens on the flight and after the flight.  I don't know if it's the same flight, but
where Cobb wakes up is where the movie also started--even if it may not show that. 

The point is not that the movie inception was a dream, but that what we call reality is a dream, and therefore, probably
a dream within a dream--multiplied by infinity.   

And since your life is most  likely a dreamed existence, within a dreamed existence, that all you can do is use the tools
and awareness that you do have to create the life you want.  This means, first, confronting the inceptions that have
infected your mind and ideas that have taken deep roots and facing and letting go of all those layers of things like 
guilt, remorse, unloving, etc.  Whether they are attached to your parents, your childhood, your relationships, yourself, or a mixture 
of them all. ",2014-12-07T19:10:42Z

Well, let me destroy your 'evidence' real quick then.

First,  Cobb's totem:

The spinning top is NOT his totem, it's his wife's one and I think almost everybody will agree with that, if not go and watch the movie again. It's just a misleading symbol for both Cobb and the audience.

So what is Cobb's totem? Well I think he has two of them.

The first one is his wife being alive. She is alive in every single dream and only there.
The second totem is the fact he can't or don't want to see his children's faces while he is dreaming a 'lie'.
He only can accept to see them at the top, the reality.

Now look at the final scene, his wife is finally gone and he is able see his children, both things that would never have happened in a dream. Not exactly the way the original (physical) totems work but a personal indicator for him to define a dream.
The spinning top is a useless totem and really a symbol for his wife. He learns to give it up in order to go back to reality just like he did with his wife in the deepest level.

So it doesn't matter if it falls or not, he ignoring it and then look at his children instead is the important thing here.

Then think back to the scene with Ariadne at the Cafe.
What is the first thing Cobb teaches her about a dream? - You never know how you got there.
What is the first thing Cobb tells Fischer at the hotel to show him it's a dream? - You never know how you got there.

Well we literally saw how Cobb got to the final scene. He left the plane, passed the airport check, got picked up by his dad and arrived at his house. He didn't just appear there out of nowhere like in the scenes before (hotel, snow base...)

You still can think the ending is a dream but therefor everything you see also needs to be part of a dream, including the whole mission, the team, the dream sharing itself, hell even the story of Cobb and his wife.
So what would be the point of this movie if everything is fake? Not very likely imo.

Of course this is just what I think, I don't want to say it's the only true meaning of the story, just what matches the best from my point of view.",2015-01-03T04:05:02Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@jennalacroix1347,"Not quite destroyed at all, since you missed something. It's stated that you don't wake up immediately from the Limbo, the deepest part of your mind, into reality.
So, while Ariadne and the others waked up layer by layer, somehow, Cobb and Saito appeared, from the lowest level, into reality.
Instead of waking up in the snowy place. The bad thing about missing this little detail, is that all of the theory is now screwed up. It's like a math problem, one wrong number and the whole problem will be wrong.

 I've watched the movie 3 times now, I don't need to watch it again, so, do you remember who left the van? Ariadne, Fischer, all of them. Only Cobb and Saito are never rescued from the sinking van.

Therefore Cobb is actually dreaming and is in the third layer and the others are indeed in the real world because they were ""Kicked"". But Cobb and Saito were left in the van while they were still in the dream. since the others have already woken up. There is no one in that dream layer to wake Cobb and Saito up.﻿

Also, the top continued to spin until Cobb was reunited with his children, being aware of it or not, he didn't even care anymore. When he saw his children, he accepted the dream as reality and that's when the top started wobbling. ﻿
Many people claim the top was about to fall, and indeed it was, because Cobb was now in the same situation as his wife, his dream became now a reality, and since it's a reality now, the top should stop.

Not to mention, in the 2-3 times Cobb spins the top during the movie, it lasts around 15-20 seconds tops.
The most solid proof (or one of the most) that he never made it out is the fact that the top spins 50 bloody seconds, twice as longer.
It's when he holds his children that, for him, that's his reality now :)",2015-01-03T04:30:02Z

This doen't matter because it's the dream world. The important thing is that he remembers how he got there in the real world.

Also the movie never told us how to escape the limbo. Nobody ever said that you need to go through all the stages again to escape it. According to the movie however Cobb already escaped the limbo once, so he probably knows how to do it. We don't.",2015-01-16T10:35:03Z

It does matter, it's actually the key you are choosing to ignore. In the real world, they are all in the van, and they all escape except for Cobb and Saito, no one comes back for them nor is it ever shown they left the sinking van. That's because they were left there.

Back in the dream, Cobb was going back for Saito, and they should have woken up in the third layer, the snowy place. Since it's stated you can't wake up directly into the real world without going layer after layer.
However he ""wakes up"" all they way from the deepest later into the real world, and you are not shown how that happens, since it doesn't happen at all.

The reason the top starts wobbling is because the moment he hugs his children, he embraces that as his reality, therefore the top stops spinning. As I said, the top spins for almost a minute, something impossible, and suddenly wobbles when he hugs his children. :)",2015-01-17T00:54:47Z

The real world is not the van wtf!? o.O
It's the plane etc.
The van is part of the first layer.

However the movie never told us how to escape the limbo. The limbo is not a standard dream like the layers before, so you clearly can't tell that they need to wake up in the snow layer in order to get out of there.
This only applies to the standard dreams...

If Cobb already escaped the limbo once, how would he not recognize still being stuck in a dream this time? Makes no sense at all.

The top isn't a totem as I already pointed out before, it's his wifes totem and so it doesn't work for him. It's just a misleading symbol for both Cobb and the audience.",2015-01-17T02:52:16Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@jennalacroix1347,"TheWambo333
It's logic! If you can't wake up, for example, from the 2nd layer directly into the real world, how could you possibly wake up from the deepest of all layers, the Limbo, straight into reality?

And yes yes, sorry for that, the van was the 1st layer, anyway, the point stands. Remember they were sedated in the plane, when you die in the Limbo and you do not wake up (Because of the sedative) you enter a state where you no longer know if you are dreaming or not. Just like Cobb's wife suffered.

I know the top is not his totem, and it's not that he doesn't recognize he's in a dream, it's the fact that afyer finally seeing his children, he does not longer cares, that's his reality now. And in that reality, the top (Whether it's his totem or not) should stop spinning.

It's very hard, you have no idea how many theories are out there, and how many people claim it's a dream and how many say it's not.
I truly believe there is no right answer, since there is always a missing link in both theories.",2015-01-17T03:42:27Z

Cobb knew this but didn't want to accept the fact and that's why she kept showing up, it was part of his sub-conscious telling him the truth about the whole situation and trying to set him free from this dream.

So if Cobb took some really strong acid and happened to be a mix of Stephen King and Christopher Nolan, then passed out, it could be very probably that he would have the craziest fucking dream of his life.

Also, you're wrong again, It jumps from him being in the airport, to him in his house, which is where the memory of him and his kids always takes place, where's the in between car ride?

Why does the kid say at the end ""We're building a hose on a cliff""? Listen closely.

“The way the end of that film worked, Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, Cobb – he was off with his kids, he was in his own subjective reality,” said Nolan. “He didn’t really care any more, and that makes a statement: perhaps, all levels of reality are valid.”


The film-maker used the spinning-top puzzler to make the point that reality and dreams do not exist in mutual isolation. “In the great tradition of these speeches [to undergraduates], generally someone says something along the lines of ‘chase your dreams’, but I don’t want to tell you that because I don’t believe that,” he said. “I want you to chase your reality.”


Nolan added: “I feel that, over time, we started to view reality as the poor cousin to our dreams, in a sense ... I want to make the case to you that our dreams, our virtual realities, these abstractions that we enjoy and surround ourselves with, they are subsets of reality.”

So it's not a dream, it's just a metaphor that we each find our own reality, and that's why Cobb didn't bother to even check to see if the top was wobbling and about to fall. Nowhere does Nolan say that the top doesn't tell Cobb if he is dreaming or not; he simply says that Cobb doesn't bother to look at the end, and that's why he cuts away before the top can fall.",2015-07-24T23:36:25Z

It's nothing but a challenge to what she said. And not in order to say _Therefore you could be in the Matrix!_ but in order to show that she is living a life without knowing.

I don't Cobb made it, I believe he got trapped. 
The look on Saito's, Arthur's and Ariadne's face's on the plane clearly shows that they were just casually taking note of Cobb whilst flying (particularly Saito's), Robert at the baggage reclaim just had a sense of Deja Vu that's all... really unlikely that Cobb would of managed to escape the transfusion of the 3/4 layer dream from before and the spinning top toy which spins and spins for too long emphasises this.

XQPy88-E2zo,@TheWambo333,"My first conclusion is that the ending is real, let me explain why and please excuse my english.


First, Cobb's totem:

The spinning top is NOT his totem, it's his wife's one and I think almost everybody will agree with that, if not go and watch the movie again. It's just a misleading symbol for both Cobb and the audience.

The wedding ring is also NOT his totem, he doesn't even notice it a single time. It's just a nonrelevant detail produced by his subconscious, like all those random people in the city, you can't even remember.
In every of Cobb's dreams, his wife is alive. Result: subconscious produces the wedding ring automatically.
If he would dream of her being dead, the ring wouldn't be there neither but as the movie told us, he can't do that anymore.

So what is Cobb's totem? Well I think he has two of them.

The first one is his wife being alive. Like I said before she is alive in every single dream and only there.
The second totem is the fact he can't or don't want to see his children's faces while he is dreaming a 'lie'.
He only can accept to see them at the top, the reality.

Now look at the final scene, his wife is finally gone and he is able see his children, both things that would never have happened in a dream. Not exactly the way the original (physical) totems work but a personal indicator for him to define a dream.
The spinning top is a useless totem and really a symbol for his wife. He learns to ignore it in order to go back to reality just like he did with his wife in the deepest level before the Limbo.

So it doesn't matter if it falls or not, he ignoring it and then look at his children instead is the important thing.
Classical Mind F****


Second, Cobb is experienced in escaping the Limbo, we are not:

A lot of people think that he made it out of Limbo but is stuck in the now empty snow base level, where he just thinks of the flight/children scenes. Why do I think this is not very likely?

Well, the movie tells us that Cobb already did escape the Limbo before.
How would he not recognize still being stuck in a dream level this time? Doesn't make sense to me.
Plus they never told us how to escape the Limbo, did they?
So how do you know he has to go through all of those stages in order to make it out?
I think he knows better than we do ;)


You still can think the ending is a dream but therefor everything you see also needs to be part of a dream, including the whole mission, the team, the dream sharing itself, hell even the story of Cobb and his wife.
For me this would get way to abstract and hard to combine.

Of course this is just what I think, I don't want to say it's the only true meaning of the story, just what matches the best from my point of view.

Let me know what you think :)",2014-08-13T00:46:59Z

That freaking TOP!  WTF?  Way to set up another sequel Hollywood. I just wish for once they'd make a film that has closure, instead of leading us into the box office like trained rats.  You know what?  I've made up my mind:  he's really dreaming all of this stuff up and the totem doesn't exist.  As a matter of fact, Cobb is a dream.  F.U.",2014-08-08T12:29:14Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@Gamefr3akable,"I personally think that he made it out of Limbo.. Remembering what Cobb said, you ALWAYS remember how you got somewhere if your not dreaming. If your dreaming, you don't remember how you got to the point you are at. Cobb clearly remembers how he got on that plane along with the rest of the crew. Not only that, but Cobb is not wearing his wedding ring.. Which means he is in reality. Also, since he is with Micheal Caine, it means he is in real life, Caine developed the dream sequence.. Of course he can tell the difference and not. I personally think he made it out of Limbo and did the job Inception perfectly. ",2014-08-04T15:22:52Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@TheWambo333,"The fact that he remembers how he got there at the end is a strong indication that it's real, also with Caine, the plane, airport and all those happenings we consider being real during the entire movie, also just being a dream, where the hell would all of this start? I mean seriously, how would this movie make sense if there is no part being real at all.
This just would get way to weird and complex, so I also think the ending is real but I only watched the movie once, maybe I will change my mind within time :P
Anyway the wedding ring theory is nonsense, it's a detail produced by his subconscious mind, not a totem.
He always wears it in his dreams because his wife is only alive in there -> subconscious mind produces ring.
If he would have a dream with his wife being dead, the ring wouldn't be there neither but he can't do that as we can see.",2014-08-12T22:50:02Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Bovvmen,"This is why I think that Dom actually escapes limbo:
When he and Saito are underwater, it is agreed that they have died are in limbo. This is because Saito is shown as an old man. Essentially, the sedative had to wear off at some point, but in order to escape limbo, you had to acknowledge the dream state and then find a way to escape (EX: when Dom plants the idea into Mal's mind that death was the only escape when they were both in limbo). While in limbo, we see that Saito remembers the arrangement he had made and they say ""Come Back"" (meaning they have both acknowledged that they are in limbo). I presume that in order to escape, Saito shoots both Dom and himself (immediately before they escape and Dom wakes up in the plane, we see that Saito is reaching for a gun). Furthermore, while on the plane after escaping limbo, Saito makes the phone call, acknowledging their agreement.",2014-06-01T08:16:11Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@heels9933,"No one should eliminate the idea that he is still dreaming because 1) Mal did ask the right questions, why were anonymous corporations chasing him in random parts of the world? 2)Mal said the reason Cobb could see the kids, was because they were projections in his head, this goes perfectly with everything Arthur says about inception. 3)Cobb can't sleep without inception, so he would do it all the time while in his ""real world"". In one point of the film, one of the characters say that eventually their dreams become their reality. 4) the totem that Cobb uses the entire time, was Mal's totem. It was HER object to use to determine reality. And each person had to create their own, it was so crucial to have their own, that another person couldn't even touch the other's totem. Ariadne had her chess pawn she created, one of the others had dice etc. My point is, they never showed Cobb having his own totem, therefore from the start, using Mal's totem is flawed. The totem he uses in theory, doesn't serve the function it was intended to, because it's not his. So, does it even matter if it was spinning or not? If it's not his totem, of his own creation, then it can't help him determine what is and isn't real. 5) And lastly, the totem WAS still spinning.
What if, when Mal jumped from that building, she ACTUALLY WOKE UP TO THE REAL WORLD. It's insane and very possible. I feel that Mal had a better grip of reality, considering Cobb had so easily gone dream in to dream, and at one point ended up in limbo. He wasn't careful.
I'm not saying he was in a dream for sure, but I think some people are too confident he woke up. I, on the other hand, have no idea what to believe. Hence why this movie is brilliant.",2014-05-30T08:06:54Z

If it were to keep spinning, it'd still remain upright, the little wobble at the end is essentially saying ""Yeah, he got out""
Had Nolan cut the scene before the top started to wobble, I'd understand that people would question it, but the wobble is essentially the reveal.

Whenever he gets into a dream he has the ring, so it is either a projection like the Train,Mal,The back of his kids or it's a proof that he's in reality, cause whenever he's not wearing it he's in the Real world.

XQPy88-E2zo,@whoryare,"i have two theories: 

1. everything that happens after cobb tries the sedative for the first time is a dream. they said 5 minutes of sleep is worth about an hour... and the people in that ""den"" using the sleeping machines (i dunno what they are called) are there for 10 hours on some occaisions. after he tries the sedative he goes into the bathroom to wash his face and goes to spin his totem, but drops it and before he can try again, he leaves the room and you dont see him spin it again until the final scene of the movie.
2. all the ""inception"" was to try and pull cobb out of limbo. he was stuck in his dreams trying to keep the memory of his wife alive so they go into his subconscious and plant the idea of all this elaborate stuff to get him to realize hes dreaming. i think the scene where he sees michael caine for the first time and he says ""come back to reality"" shows that. also, watch the scene where saito is an old man and cobb has gone into limbo to get him, but imagine that saito is talking to cobb instead of the other way around (if that makes any sense) and then look at the expression on leo's face when he talks to the old man saito and also when he wakes up. also, you never actually see them kill themselves, so they could have just been hooked up to the ""inception machine"" and it finished (remember when ariadne tries it for the first time? he says try another 5 minutes, so my guess is they can regulate the time of the dream). ",2014-04-20T13:40:22Z

the point in this ending though is that it doesn't really matters to him anymore whether it's a dream or not, at the moment he sees his kids he stops caring about the spinning top. he stops caring about reality or dreams. he gets to be with his family again, and that's all he wanted.",2014-08-01T09:30:03Z

A totem is not only unnecessary but the main way for it to function is simply being the only one who knows its weight. The spinning isn't key to all totems. This one is just more efficient and easier to use because there are 2 ways to tell; weight, and eternal or limited spinning. If you wanted it to fall, that would take away that way to tell if it's your dream.

Cobb's totem, the spinning top, was never his own. It was Mal's. So we're not sure if it works properly for him. The actual totem that Cobb had, was the wedding ring in his finger. In dreams, he can still be seen wearing it, while In reality, he abandoned it. Because in dream, he's still together with his wife, while in reality, his wife died and so on he abandoned the ring.

XQPy88-E2zo,@shizolein,"@Aka5787658 sorry for being late, the answer to your question is: 

remember, you're supposed not to show anyone else how your totem works, right (keep that in mind)?

So, let's say, Cobb is in the real world: The totem is doing what physics ( keep that in mind) makes it to do: after a while, it stops spinning and drops off. 
Now, think of Cobb being in someone else's dream: if the dreammaker doesn't know of Cobb's totem ""behavior""- which is to stop spinning after a while, how the dreammaker can make it ""behaving"" just like in the real world? Right, he/ she can't.

It's just the same like in one of the first scenes with the wrong carpet surface.

At least this is my theory. 

But this theory doesn't make it legit a 100%, because, let's say Cobb is still in limbo. How should his totem not work as he is kind of his own dreammaker? He knows exactly how his totem behaves in real world, so basically, I think the totem will stop spinning at the end. But after all this will not tell you, if Cobb is still in limbo or not.

It's more likely that Cobb gives a shit about it and enjoys the whatever it is quality time with his kids.",2018-11-16T00:52:33Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@expedion6005,"Ok, for those that say that Cobb's ring around the finger tells if hes in a dream or not is not necessarily true. Because the ring finger on and off (ring on being a dream and ring finger off being reality) could pretty much be something that he's constructed in his 1st layer of dream state. See, Cobb tells occasionally about how he and his wife finally woke up from the dream but his wife was still skeptical about it being reality, she might've been right and that she committed suicide because she knew it was another dream layer. So Cobb was essentially stuck in the dreamstate himself, with the belief that his wife killed herself because she couldn't differentiate from reality and dreamstate. When in fact, it is Cobb that can't differentiate between reality and dreamstate because he believed that to what he awoke to with his wife, was the reality. So therefore Cobb has also constructed an entire belief in this dreamstate in which hee got stuck: That his wife is dead because she couldn't differentiate between dream and reality, that he shouldn't wear the ring and so forth. But in the end, Cobb is the one stuck in a dream with bunch of characters around him. So when they speak about a 3rd layer dreamstate. It's actually a 4th layer dream state. Because the 1st layer dream state is Cobb's baseline of his own living dream of which he believes is the reality and in which he has strongly convinced himself that his wife killed herself in the real world. (when it's actually Cobb's first dream layer that he's living in with the belief that THAT is the reality). So Cobb.... is still stuck in a dream. He just came back to his 1st layer. Or who knows, might be that he slipped into a 5th layer state in which he uses his 1st layer to project its characteristics upon the 5th layer state (The state that he awakes to in the plane).

So, was he in Saito's dream? Da hell, the entire idea that he works for some organisation that specializes in extraction of dreams, could be Cobb's entire dream.  Because after all.... you're never told about how he got in the entire extraction field in the first place. It's all just the instant assumption from the get go that he is some sort of skilled extractor... So inception 2, could actually be a nice sequel telling the story before he slipped into a dreamstate. What happened before all of that? What was his REAL life like?

There are also pieces of fruit on the table, which are Michael Caine's totems as they are on the table it is clearly shown to the world that Nolan's vision for Cobb is that he is in reality.

XQPy88-E2zo,@roo7227,"Luke Li

But that's only because he perceives that reality as ""real"".. Watch the movie, again, and see if this explanation makes sense..

The kids are not real.. THEY ARE THE INCEPTION.. Just as it was explained about how the inception would be executed to Cilliain Murphy's character (Fischer), by implanting on one level, then reimplanting deeper, the kids are first mentioned by Moll, in the very first scene of the movie (when Cobb uses her to weight the chair so he can tie a rope to it and vault down to the floor below, to access Saito's ""safe"").. Then, the inception is reimplanted with the phone call at the flat before the helicopter ride with Saito, and Saito's offer to return to them (the kids, and the US)..

This would explain quite a few things, such as why Cobb sees these kids everywhere he goes?.. Wouldn't that be consistent with how ""inception"" was explained, earlier in the film?.. That it grows like a wild fire?..

And one thing that bothers me about any other explanation, is why Moll and Cobb would ever explore limbo in the first place, if they had kids?.. That, literally, makes no sense, at all?.. They wouldn't abandon two young kids because they wanted to be some kind of half-assed pioneers, would they?..

Plus, there are other clues, such as getting caught in obvious mazes, and the characters always just arrive where they are going, like in a dream.. It all adds up to, IMO, the inception was happening from the opening credits of the movie..",2013-12-11T11:14:46Z

In the house, Saito shot himself and went one layer up which is suppose to be filled with Fisher's subconscious. But Fisher and the rest had already woke up. So, when Saito went into that layer, he automatically will think he is in the plane, and when Cobb went into the layer, he will be in Saito's subconscious. Which is why it can also be that he is stuck in Saito's dream when his children seems like Saito's subconscious. :)",2014-01-05T15:09:09Z

The house on the cliff is a constriction seen in Saito's dream. Saito envisioned the airplane reality, which previously was the snow fortress level, after he woke up from his limbo. Cobb followed him there. Also how did Mal make it over to the other window on an adjacent building. That strange aspect was never realized by Cobb because they were still in Cobb's dream at that moment. Cobb should have jumped off with Mal. Mal is still alive. ",2013-11-10T11:36:27Z

It's about asking the right question. It's not a question of if he is in a dream or not. The biggest question is if you had everything you wanted in life would you care if it was a dream? How could you ever know? What if you never find out that you're living in eternity. I compare this film to concepts of The Matrix and Vanilla Sky. ,2013-08-30T14:28:07Z

Always when cobb is in a dream he wears a marriage ring because in his dreams mal is still alive. When he is in the real world he dont have any ring on his finger. When you see him spinn the totem at the end look at his left hand. If he is wearing a ring it is a dream if he is not its real.

If you're going to distract the audience with a red herring of sorts, that's fine, but you can't also distract your main character with it, unless he's in the same position as the audience.  In this case, you've already established that he's not by saying that he stole the top (his wife's totem) and that his wedding ring is his totem.  

So, we're back to, why is the character so focused on spinning the top?  And why isn't he checking his wedding ring?",2013-06-04T19:15:55Z

He's spinning that thing to test if he's still dreaming. In his dreams, if he spins it, it never topples. In real life it does. So if it doesn't fall over, he knows the world he's in isn't real.

If they died before the sedatives ran out, they would be trapped in limbo, but, with the kicks, they wake up in each level, going back up to reality. Cobb however would have to use the gun as his extra kick to bring Saito back with him. If he didn't use the gun to kill himself, he wouldn't be waking up in the plane. He'd still be speaking with Saito (Old saito).

XQPy88-E2zo,@Eddyjj24baller,the ending implied the either a. he woke up out the dream or b. he was still in a dream. if he was out of the dream then the only two ways he made was he made a drop in all levels and the movie didnt show it or he just woke up because a dream could'nt last forever(unless the person is killed in a 3 or more staged dream). Finally when the top was spining the wanted to leave the audience wondering if it was still a dream or reality. I think it was reality but nobody knows except for the writer.,2013-03-21T02:32:16Z

I think what we're supposed to take away is that it no longer matters whether he's in a dream or not, because Cobb has accepted reuniting with his kids as his reality. It's real to him, meaning that even if he were in a dream he wouldn't want to wake from it.",2013-03-02T20:31:29Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@rickloos1654,"I just watched the movie for the first time and there is one thing I have not seen in any commentary to date.  The top totem was Mal's not Cobb's.  To me, that means this all happened in Cobb's limbo.  He lost himself and reached for his wife's totem as an alternate reality.  The ending is Cobb accepting the new limbo with his children.  I was actually figuring Mal was trying to retrieve him through violent means and the last scene would be her waking up and saying ""We've lost him again.""",2013-02-27T15:26:27Z

In the ending, once he saw his kids, he may be already know it's reality.

XQPy88-E2zo,@MrYosssup,"let me rephrase it: If I was Christopher Nolan I would have had 3 choices:

1) showing the damn thing falling, which was going to happen but it would have not been such a creative ending.
2) showing the thing keep going..that would have been a disappointing ending
3) cutting it right before falling so to create a more interesting ending.

option number 3 was the smartest option and Nolan is smart. I really doubt he had other second meanings..especially philosophical ones. ",2013-01-09T20:58:59Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@AGingerOnesChannel,"We don't know if the spinning top was going to fall, or continue spinning. It seemed to me that it was only wobbling because it was moving over a rough surface; the bumps and grooves of the wood causing it to shift slightly and altering its balance. We don't know if it regains stability afterwards or falls - that is the magic of the scene.

Personally I feel the end is a dream - particularly because of the way he looks around after entering the house as to say 'How did I get here?'",2013-01-04T16:13:02Z

The girl at the end is older its harder to tell with the little boy but the girl is very obvious if your looking for it.

XQPy88-E2zo,@NateChannelInc,"It's literally impossible for the ending to be a dream, meaning that Mal really was crazy due to Cobb's inception. My logic is that, if it was a dream, then when Mal's projection killed Cobb in limbo with the butcher's knife before Ariadne jumped off of the building to kill herself to get back to the van, Cobb woke back up in the van. But he wanted to die again to get back into limbo to get Saito. Well, that probably took at least 2 minutes, (continued in attached comment)",2012-10-04T00:56:15Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@NateChannelInc,"which would be months in limbo. Cobb died and went back to Saito, which is why Saito was so aged because it took so long for Cobb to get back + to find Saito. Cobb wasn't that aged when he found Saito because Saito had been in limbo longer. When Cobb killed himself (and Saito) in limbo, they both woke up and Cobb didn't drown. If Cobb had been in a dream when he got back to reality where he sees his kids' faces, then when Cobb died in limbo, he would've went straight back to the real reality. ",2012-10-04T00:56:06Z

I mean, that would have to mean that this dream is very different than every other one in the movie.
Also,I was really only stating hints that Christopher Nolan left for us. Why would Nolan go through all the bother to dress them up differently, and even to get different actors for this final scene?

XQPy88-E2zo,@Vi0l3nttDFO,"( Icopy and pasted this, ur theory isgood but thre are plentyofholes)
Plenty can be assumed from this. We can assume that the ending must be reality. We can assume that the ending reality must be linked to the rest of the reality throughout the film. Or maybe we can assume the ring stood for the guilt that Cobb held onto Mal, and once he got rid of the guilt, he no longer wore the ring since Mal has been let go from his subconscious. This, of course, then suggests that the conclusion is a dream.",2012-10-03T01:00:59Z

Cobb was young, life was sweet, so he could ignore it and just walk over to his kids. But Saito was old and alone in limbo, so that doubt was his only hope.",2012-09-03T10:45:16Z

It was established in the movie that cob is trying move on with his life and not live in a fantasy land. that was established by him confronting his dead wife in the end of the movie. It would be totally out of character for him to then regress so sharply out of nowhere. besides from a movie making sandpoint it would be very anticlimactic. Only the laws of physics put there by the dream maker apply in the dream.,2012-08-15T19:32:10Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@InterpolFL,"Whether it keeps spinning or falls is immaterial; the significance of the final scene is that Cobb has decided he is content with this form of reality and is no longer obsessing over whether his top falls or continues to spin. He has gotten back to his kids, he is allowed back in the U.S., and if it's all a dream it matters little to him since this reality is what he was striving to achieve.

""just happy to see his kids"" but would he be happy if he knew it was his imagination and not actually his kids. The children maybe sitting there going were is daddy and I doubt if that would make him happy at all. 

There is many deep possibilities that are laced through out the film. There is the possibility that he is also inside an other persons mind.",2012-08-13T14:06:51Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@MrHispanicz,He is in reality in the ending. It has long been stated that Michael Caine's character is never in a dream so that's how you know its real. And the totem is about to fall. It only cuts off before you can see if this is true or not because Nolan stated that Cobb didn't care whether he was really back home or not. The fact that it wobbled showed it was reality. His kids never talk to him in a dream too.  He wouldn't have been nervous either when he went through customs too if it was a dream.,2012-08-07T22:38:30Z

Earlier in the movie it seemed like everyone knew and remembered just about everything from the dreams when they woke up.

I guess it has to do with the same thing that makes you know or not know you are dreaming. Cobbs entire team where artificially inserted into a dream thus they knew from start they where dreaming and will remember it completely upon waking up.

XQPy88-E2zo,@BigFatBiatch,The best way to figure out whether Cobb is dreaming or not is to look for his wedding ring.  Whenever he's in his or anyone elses dream the ring is always on his hand. For example when everybody falls asleep on the plane we see Cobbs hand fall off the armrest with no ring but then through all the dream levels he's got it back on again.  If you look really closely when he picks up his bag at the airport theres no ring on his finger which would mean he's back in reality.  I hope so anyway :),2012-06-16T23:08:22Z

When the screen goes black at the end is when the dreamer wakes up from the dream. In the movie it's explained that you never know how you got there, you're just in the middle of the action. Think about how a dream happens.. it's like being in a movie or watching one.. what happens when you wake up? The screen goes black and you wake up.

I'd love to see another film or anything else set in this universe but its probably best left where it is. I've persuaded myself Cobb in no longer in a dream at the end since we see his kids faces and that the totem does appear to be begin toppling, but I preferred being unsure.

XQPy88-E2zo,@killamatrix1,@snparadice to clarify things it is real simple. The clues are there. Everytime he is dreaming he has his ring on because he couldn't let go of Mal. When the movie starts he is in limbo and when he is eating oatmeal u see his ring which is key.The whole movie they try to hide his left hand. U have to realize he let go in reality and never had the ring on. When he wakes up from the plane he has no ring on which means he got to see his children for real. So he really was awake.,2011-12-16T20:46:28Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@killamatrix1,I figuered out the answer is just like the sixth sense. You gotta pay attention to his left hand in the beggining of the movie. He had a wedding ring. At the end he had no ring. There u go.,2011-12-15T10:05:07Z

The point is, we can never be sure. So the ending remains a mystery as we question whether Leo's reality is in fact a dream, as we ourselves question if OUR reality, or our lives, is actually all a dream.

It's nice to see a director assuming that his audience is intelligent and can appreciate a blockbuster with a complicated story. So many films can be spoiled because the end has been tampered with  because audiences are presumed to want a happy ending every time.

I think another thing to note is that other people are not supposed to see the artifact he uses.. yet the audience does.

The totem does still work too, the only reason you don't let others touch it is so that they cannot fake your totem inside one of their dreams. All this means is that if Cobb ever enter's Sieto's dreams, the totem will not work and Cobb will not know he's asleep.

I'd like to think he's not, but if he could only get to his children in a dream I'd rather him that then wake up and have to be without them for the rest of his life. That's why there's no need to see the top stop spinning. All we were hoping was for him to get back to his family, so that's ALL Nolan gave us, period.",2011-07-02T18:16:32Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@Exiio,"@Riwillion More or less, he is right. The main reason he always checked the totem was because Mal killed herself because she thought the real world was a dream, so he always checked because he regret what happened. It's well established that the world is real, and it does show the top begin to topple over and then the movie quickly ends. By habit he spun the top, but when he saw his kids turn their heads, he just didn't care anymore about the top because he knew it wasn't a dream.",2011-06-25T23:29:31Z

Yeah, thats another reason to believe the ending was real. He could never see his children´s faces in dreams, while in the end he could.

Maybe that was the point, but he wasnt in limbo. If it was dream world, the totem would fluently keep spinning, it would never slow down.

The problem for the ""he's in the real world"" stance (which I agree with btw) is that people that defend the view that ""it's all a dream"" or ""Cobb is still dreaming"" in the final scene, can argue that even if the top ceases to spin and falls, still, this doesn't prove that Cobb is in the ""real world"" for he could be dreaming and unconsciously ""willing"" the (projected) top to fall for the first time.

Thanks for clarifying. Understood. It's logically possible that Cobb is still in some dream state in the final scene (I don't personally think so given the visual evidence and things Nolan has said).

One problem with your comment is that Nolan admits in the Introduction of his book: ""Inception: The Shooting Script"" that Cobb's wife, Mal, is dead. She jumped to her death in the ""real world.""

Even though Fischer can't remember his dream, the inception took. And as a result of that performed inception on him (through forging the emotional concepts and identities), Fischer now has a set of false beliefs in the ""real world,"" one of them being ""I will split up my father's empire.""

Your hunch is correct. Remember what Cobb tells Fischer in the bathroom in the Hotel. Cobb says: "" It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up. It takes years of practice..."" When Fischer awakes back on the plane after hanging out in Level 1 for close to a week (his countdown clock was set to around 9.5 hrs), he doesn't remember what he was dreaming about.

XQPy88-E2zo,@SunsetSara,"@0123kid 
Also: The reason why Cobb and Saito don't return to the plane when their countdown timers expires on the dream machine is because there is an﻿ unspoken dream law that once one gets to Limbo, one can't escape it by the countdown timer and sedative stopping in reality. Cobb even says the only way to escape Limbo is for one to kill theirself. But he forgot to add: ""where this is no sedative being administered any longer"" and ""where there are no other dream levels existing anymore.""",2011-04-20T04:17:27Z

2. Cobb did not remain in Limbo after Saito shoots him in Limbo. Reason: the sedative is no longer being administered to both Cobb and Saito. The sedative vile ran out . Remember, the countdown timer was set to around 9.5 hrs on the dream machine and when it expires, the sedative stops. When the team returns to the plane, they keep the IV's in both Cobb and Saito and feed them somnacin so they continue to share the dream. Now Cobb and Saito can escape Limbo by killing themselves.",2011-04-20T04:05:47Z

Nolan also says he didn't want to alienate the audience with the business of the spinning top scenes - but he comes close to doing so in the final scene. On the one hand there is a lot of visual evidence that points to Cobb being in the ""real world"" - for example, the wedding ring visual. But there are so many explanatory visual gaps that Nolan has purposely left out that he leaves room for multiple interpretations. It's a balancing act but he pulls it off.",2011-04-14T03:55:13Z

Actually, Nolan has repeatedly said in recent interviews, that in his mind, there is a fact of the matter whether Cobb is in the ""real world"" in the final scene. He says it's up to the viewer to figure it out. So, it's not a matter of interpretation...not meant to be left unsolved...but many people falsely believe he intended it to be left unsolved. Again, if the top does fall, it doesn't prove he's in reality. But there is a lot of visual evidence that suggests he is.",2011-04-14T03:46:16Z

ACTUALLY, the children in the Final scene are TWO years older. Nolan has explicitly said this and often refers to the TWO sets of child actors that were used in the film. There is the young 3 year old Phillipa (played by Claire Geare) and the 20 month old James (played by Christopher Nolan's son, Magnus Nolan; and then the there was the 5 year old Phillipa (played by Taylor﻿ Geare) and the 3 year old James (played by Jonathan Geare). Check the cast listing on IMDB to verify.

In the end when 5 year old Phillipa comes through the back door and hugs her father, notice that the horizonal stich around the dress is now about 12-15 inches from the bottom (as opposed to the 2-3 inch horizontal line when she was 3). And the bottom of the dress in that 12-15 inch area is completely different than the one she was wearing when she was﻿ 3 years old. This dress at the end has vertical stich lines going around the dress and it flares and puffs out more.

Again, if the top falls in the final﻿ scene, it doesn't prove that Cobb is in the real world (even though I believe he's in the real world in the final scene). For, he could be dreaming and imagining for the first time that it falls. He could be projecting the top and unconsciously willing it to topple over as he walks away from it. When the top was Mal's totem, she likely willed the top to behave in a continuous spin when she projected it in a dream.

The reason why only around 15 years goes by for Cobb in Cobb's Limbo (as opposed to the 60 years for Saito) is because Cobb is a more experienced dreamer than Saito. So his mind is able to control the passage of Limbo time since he know's it's not the real world. But after a certain duration of Limbo time passes in his search for Saito, he starts to forget that Limbo isn't﻿ real. Plus, Saito ends up in Cobb's Limbo earlier than Cobb so a good deal of Limbo time has passed for him.

XQPy88-E2zo,@SunsetSara,"@hazahaxa 
You have this a bit confused. Both Saito and Cobb do not ride the synchronized series of double ""Kicks"" back because Saito is dead in dream level 1, 2 and 3 and lost in Limbo by the time they execute the synchronized double ""Kicks"" and Cobb doesn't jump off the ledge with Ariadne. Cobb and Saito can only escape Limbo when the sedative stops flowing into their arms which is about 9.5 hours in the real world and 60 years in limbo time for Saito and about 15 yrs in limbo time for Cobb.",2011-04-07T21:36:57Z

That isn't Cobb's dad. That is Mal's dad, Stephen Miles. Mal's full name was Mal Miles. Stephen's wife is Marie Miles (who is looking after Cobb's kids, Phillipa and James). Nolan's book ""Inception: The Shooting Script"" confirms all of this. Moreover, Stephen Miles being at the airport to greet Cobb doesn't imply that Cobb is dreaming. Stephen flew from Paris to Los Angeles prior to Cobb and his team performing the inception job. He and Cobb planned it this way.",2011-04-07T21:25:17Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@hazahaxa,"It has to be a simply because of how the ""kick"" works. They say throughout the film that when they have the kick it has to happen in all the dreams at the same time in order for them to wake up from it. All the kicks happen but Cobb and Saito are still in limbo. They missed the kick so they couldn't wake up. Also, it is heavily implied that they escape limbo by killing themselves with the gun, but we had already established dying in the dream would make them die in real life due to the sedative.",2011-04-07T21:11:13Z

Whoa! Not so quick. It's logically possible that it could all be one big dream from beginning to end. But there is a lot of visual evidence to suggest otherwise; also, studying Nolan's comments over the last 10 years reveals that he initially imagined a real world with real dream technology where a team of real dream thieves pull off a real dream heist against a real man, Fischer.

You're right. This is another logical possibility that's been raised as well. Nolan may have intended it this way.

XQPy88-E2zo,@TylerBurgundy,"If you truly loved this film, you wouldn't need to question whether it's a dream or not. It's fine to have an opinion, but Nolan has left it ambiguous to the audience for two reasons. Number one being that it's a happy ending, where Cobb has excepted his reality, one where he has forgotten the terrors of his wife and can freely see his kids. And number two being that Nolan, getting the response and questioning of 'Dream or Reality?', in a way has performed inception, an idea of how the film ends",2011-03-16T23:50:29Z

The spinning top isn't Cobb's dream totem so him spinning it at the end is actually irrelevant because whether it fell or not it wouldn't signify if he was awake or asleep because his dream totem is the wedding ring and he isn't wearing it at the end, the spinning top is meant to confuse you, it belonged to his wife.",2011-03-13T23:28:23Z

This is why we see the beginning scene with old Saito, and a direct voiceover into the actual beginning of the story. 

I don't think it's unfortunate he is in limbo at the end, because he truly believes he is with his children and happy.",2011-03-13T16:12:19Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@xMari95x,"@Cam1Deathsnake There are three theories to the top ""not"" stopping.

1) If you noticed, when Cobb spun the top in dreams, it always spun smoothly; at the end, it started to wobble.
2) The top was actually Mal's. and as the characters said, if someone else touched the totem, it would be void. Cobb touched Mal's totem making it void,  and the Chinese guard guy in limbo touched the top, also making it void. So whether it stopped or not wouldn't make a difference. 
3) His children were his totem.

1) Reality. Cobb left Mal memorie behind and he is ready to move on, he can finally look at his kids, also he is not wearing is wedding as he always were at dreams.
2) Limbo. At some part of the movie, they said that to know you are dreaming trie remember how we get their. And Cobb doesn´t know why he was with saito and simply appeard in the plain

The idea of its all a dream its impossible because at some parts of the movie de top stops spinning.

True, I did some checking-up after I posted that. The ring can't be his totem, since it's basically nothing. He could use Mal's totem fine, since she's dead.

Totems only tell you if you're in someone else's dream, not if  you're in your own dream. So he might well be dreaming for the whole film - it doesn't matter if the top stopped spinning, because it won't tell him if he's in his own dream.",2010-12-22T18:29:38Z

We never see them all wake up fully from the sleeping world only Cobb, we also never see the totem fall oer on the table, this leaves room for a sequel I think.
But then again the ending of this film can be interpreted in so many different ways, it is really up to the viewer to decide what happened.

It was an emotional thing, Cobb finally sees his kids after years or whatever, and they just did this huge thing. Plus CountAbel says Hans Zimmer's music is terrible, then says it's an epic score. So he contradicts himself. What does he know?",2010-11-27T23:07:54Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@SomethingToSay,@CountAbel I'm fairly sure you didn't see the movie if you really think that. Or you're an idiot. I'd be delighted to hear which,2010-11-26T06:43:42Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@delta2ish,@CountAbel not really this isnt for epic matters this is for powerful scenes and tahts what happend here it was a very powerful scene with powerful music,2010-11-26T01:11:47Z
XQPy88-E2zo,@CountAbel,"I think Hans Zimmer's music is getting worse and worse. This soundtrack, especially, mostly gave me a headache.

Even this scene is a perfect example of the worst usage of music ever. Epic, orchestral score... while nothing is happening. Seriously, what's the point?",2010-11-25T17:32:53Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@StefanJato,Couldn't have been a better ending. The little wobble gives the viewer a hope of reality while still it still cuts it off to leave lingering suspicion of dreaming,2010-11-19T21:09:56Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@LimitbreakerStudios,"@VastedCouth
yeah i get it know. i watched inception again, and I caught all those things. The reason I didn't get that stuff was because while Cobb and Saito were explaining that stuff, I was still focusing on dreams and how they worked and comparing the dreams in the movie to dreams in reality. I got sidetracked lol",2010-11-10T21:57:26Z

XQPy88-E2zo,@LimitbreakerStudios,"@TheEIPfan
ok, i see that stuff now, but specifically, why did Inception itself enable Cobb to go home. I know performing inception on fisher made him change his mind about his father's company, but how does that enable Cobb to go home.
Cobb was already on the plane on his way home, what if he failed at Inception? he'd still be on the plane and he would've arrived home anyway",2010-11-09T01:24:24Z
