YoHD9XEInc0,@ashokchoudhary5136,"Inception doesn’t warn you about dreams.  
It warns you about the one thing harder than waking up: deciding which reality is worth waking up to.

Its quiet, devastating lesson is this:  
We all carry a spinning top in our pocket; memories of someone we lost, a version of life that felt truer, a guilt we can’t forgive.  
We keep returning to it because staying in the dream (where they’re still alive, where we’re still good) hurts less than facing the truth.

Cobb’s final crime isn’t stealing secrets.  
It’s learning that letting go isn’t betrayal; clinging to the ghost forever is.

When that top wobbles but we never see it fall, the film whispers the real question straight into your chest:  
If you had the choice to live in a beautiful lie with the person you love…  
would you have the courage to wake up?

Inception leaves you staring at your own life, suddenly unsure which layer you’ve been afraid to leave, and whether the ground under your feet is solid, or just the dream you’re finally ready to end.",2025-11-17T12:44:39Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@the3sided,"The movie was fairly straightforward. The first few minutes were a bit confusing because we didn’t know it was about dreams (I hadn’t watched the trailer). Once we realized it centered on creating dreams and crafting an alternate reality, it became much clearer.
The story revolves around getting Fischer to dream and taking that dream three layers deep to make him believe it’s real. They present level 1 as a dream to him at level 2, then guide him to level 3. However, complications arise for Cobb because of his wife. He and Ariadne go down to confront these issues, and later, Cobb stays behind to rescue Saito, who is trapped there after dying in a dream.

As for the ending, that is a bit confusing. It looked like the spinning top was losing momentum and was about to fall which would mean that this world was real, but we never saw it. So there is a possibility that it was a dream all along. (that's just what I think)",2025-09-16T05:14:24Z

So I said ""ok, Lord play ""Come as you are"". 
I turned on the radio and the song started playing right there on the spot, perfectly…
I started getting flooded with chills like a waterfall, crying, and trembling. 
He stayed with me for 10 minutes in my driveway. until I got outta the car.

A couple months after that I started getting amazing prayers answered way more often, because it helped me quit doubting when I pray and I was lined up with biblical instructions. It's 7 years later and I still get answered prayers in Jesus name.",2025-05-27T23:39:47Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@cinemedia0,"### **Inception (2010) – The Heist That Messed with Our Heads** 🌀💭  

**""You mustn’t be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.""**  
And boy, did Christopher Nolan dream **BIG** with this one!  

#### **Plot (If You Can Call It That 😆)**  
Leonardo DiCaprio (Dom Cobb) is a **professional dream thief**—a guy who can **break into your subconscious and steal secrets**. But this time, he’s tasked with doing the impossible: **planting an idea instead of stealing one.**  

With his **elite dream squad**—a forger (Tom Hardy), an architect (Elliot Page), and a chemist (Dileep Rao)—Cobb dives through **layers of reality**, dodging gunfights, gravity-defying corridors, and his own **dead wife haunting his dreams.**  

#### **Why It’s a Masterpiece?**  
🔥 **That hallway fight? Pure cinema.**  
🔥 **Hans Zimmer’s *BWAAAM* score? Instant chills.**  
🔥 **The spinning top ending? Still arguing about it.**  
🔥 **Tom Hardy’s suave energy? Absolute scene-stealer.**  

💭 **Dream or Reality?**  
That’s the million-dollar question. **Did the top fall, or was Cobb still dreaming?** 🤯  

⭐ **Rating:** **9.99/10** (because we’re still trying to wake up from this movie)  

So, did you get lost in the layers, or are you the *one* who understood it all? 😏",2025-03-17T04:48:02Z

Seeing the trailer would make me agonize over the time I had to wait to see the movie, and the wait was so excruciating, the mystery so in need of solving, that I could barely contain my feelings. A borderline obsession created that can only be satisfied by seeing the movie finally. 

I remember that feeling after seeing the preview for The Matrix, for instance, and I used to feel that giddy excitement pretty frequently... maybe once every couple years, depending.

During the session, Charlene kept repeating “obey me, obey me, always obey me”. What Cobb didn't know was that Charlène was an expert in inception and female supremacy, and that she had incorporated subliminal messages into her hypnosis session that encouraged people to become addicted to female supremacy. Charlène had succeeded in implanting the desire to adhere to female supremacy in Cobb's mind, leading him to adopt a subservient attitude towards his girlfriends and the chicks he hit on in the street. Since Cobb had become addicted to female supremacy because of Charlène's inception session, he began to do everything in his power to promote his girlfriends' professional careers, and he did everything in his power to popularize the inception session with subliminal messages from Charlène.  Since Charlène's inception session had been listened to by thousands of people, thousands of men had become hooked on female supremacy and Charlène had succeeded. When Cobb talked about his activities around him since undergoing Charlène's inception session, he had a different way of approaching the matter depending on the type of person he was dealing with, so in Cobb's discourse there were levels of understanding nested within other levels of understanding.",2025-01-30T20:19:19Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@СергейАкимов-ъ9р,"Надо всегда говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ, имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА, либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА, либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит, каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. ""ПРИВОДИТЬ"" НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. 

МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое НЕ УПОМИНАНИЕ(где бы то ни было) об Отце нашем небесном, подарившим для наших душ жизнь вечную, которая может испытывать такую блаженственную радость, но мы сами не хотим этого своей греховной жизнью, И также любое УПОМИНАНИЕ О БОГЕ в фильме ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), И СЛОВА ЛЮБОВЬ, потому что Бог есть Любовь, ВСЁ ЭТО обычное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый страшный грех если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам ФИЛЬМ прежде всего НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества СТРАШНЫХ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ (наши духовные болезни), например таких как ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ЗАВИСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ВИНОПИТИЕ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, ПОХОТЬ, БЛУД, СТРАХ, НЕМОЩЬ, И главное и очень сильно ЛУКАВСТВО. Потому что всё что происходит в фильме не имеет вообще никакого смысла, побуждая самих зрителей искать его и он у всех разный. Именно так и разжигается это страшная порочная страсть. И ВОТ, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ(не понимают), и ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым собственным ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. А вот что всё же имеет смысл в этом фильме. Из фильма можно понять как работает в душе живого человека второй демон мучитель лукавства. Это либо мужчина, либо женщина, а основной всегда мужчина, но двух типов. Он подчиняет себе всё мысли и волю самого живого человека. Поэтому внимание. Если человека живёт на земле без Бога, знайте все ваши мысли и действия не ваши а этого демона. Приведёт это любого живого человека рано или поздно к катастрофическим последствиям для него. И ВОТ как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО всё очень «глубокие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.

А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.

И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.

Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет ""БОРОТЬСЯ"" СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. 

А ЧТОБЫ  ""ПРИЙТИ"" к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  

Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ у каждого человека его земной жизни ОСТАЛОСЬ ОЧЕНЬ МАЛО, придёт СМЕРТЬ, И ВСЁ )СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ ""шагом"" БУДЕТ (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻",2024-11-06T18:56:23Z

Today, such concepts are considered to be “risky” as the possibility of the movie being a flop is higher (because general audiences aren’t familiar with the new idea like they are with other popular franchises). Inception ended up being a big success (critical and financially) and was the the 4th highest grossing movie of 2010 :)",2024-09-27T21:22:52Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@ИльяКаюров-ф1у,"Итак, НАЧАЛО  

Трудно раскрывать мысль, а внедрить? Фильм об этом 

Итак, Кристофер, идея тянется с 70-х ходов прошлого века и 

Фишер не просто фамилия, это образ, шахматиста, известного шахматиста, девятки 


В итоге, он отказался от власти; его группа уже не первая - был ещё буйный норвежец, ну да ладно 

Многоуровневая схема внедрения активно применяется в политических и псевдополитических областях, и не только, Вы сами это показали; практически любой человек становится объектом ВНЕДРЕНИЯ 


Попробуем выявить некоторых политиков, известных не менее, чем объект 

Два Владимира - Путин и Зеленский 
Разница в возрасте не важна, это и так понятно, что важно, тогда 

В первую очередь, фамилия, конечно - это есть признак, по которому мы узнаём объект 

В исторической конструкции есть зацикленность, когда ДОВОД не нужен, это предопределено 

Путин и Примаков в начале XX века, Путин и Примаков в конце XX века 

Зеленский Исаак Абрамович и, продолжение следует 


Когда это начинается? НАЧАЛО 
Со школы, - от даты президентства вычитайте 30 лет, далее ваш сценарий, по фильму, трёхуровневый сон или что-то ещё; в общем, интересного немного, математика, ИНТЕГРАЛА ПРИМЕНЕНИЕ

No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore. 23 The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you anymore.

They could have warped it by skipping time, if not by effects. First they're in one location, then in another. By changing the culprits, by amount, method. Or by changing point of view. That section was kind of boring, too linear. I think it was because they were explaining too many mind games. Play them. We'll catch up, or not.

YoHD9XEInc0,@asadithyan3542,"""Inception"" delves into theoretical concepts in neuroscience and dream psychology. The film revolves around the idea of shared dreaming and manipulating dreams to extract or implant information. The fictional technology in the movie allows individuals to enter a dream state and interact with the dreams of others.

The science fiction elements involve the exploration of subconscious minds, dream layers, and the concept of time dilation within dreams. While the specific technology portrayed in the movie is fantastical, it draws inspiration from real-world discussions on dream research and the nature of consciousness.

It's important to note that ""Inception"" takes creative liberties for storytelling purposes, and some aspects are not grounded in current scientific understanding. The film blends speculative ideas with cinematic imagination to create a captivating narrative.",2024-01-30T14:57:39Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@terminatedaccount8750,"people do love to fantasize. they are always ""in the zone""(subconscious, can't even remember the drive home). they love to dream about alternate realities to their own current one. always dreaming about a ""blissful utopia"" where everyone is perfect and magical. a place where their ""savior"" will help all who is ""present before him"".

eventually this utopia ""will be attacked by outside forces"" who oppose this new found utopia. the savior will need to create a policing force, to police the attackers and maintain their ideology. this magical savior will need ""fees"" from the saved, in order to keep the police force going.

since you're now paying taxes(fees), soon you will pay even more taxes. you'll need water, food, land, shelter, transportation, recreation, economy, infrastructure, medics/health, socializing, personal spaces, schooling, new discoveries and dreams to follow. you'll be taxed to death, literally.

taxes, death and unbuilt fantasies are all you will experience in life. someone(the savior) will get rich by ""selling you dreams"" of your utopia, all the while building a utopia for themselves(devils in the details). they'll be your God and you will be their peasants. 

we can call it an ""eco-system"" and the savior a ""guru"" and peasants, ""followers"" and taxes ""fees"". we can call it ""a business"" and make it sound like... it's for your own good. it's for your future. ""all the cool kids are doing it, don't you want to be cool?"" you'll follow a long because of popular mythology(controlled gossip) and not wanting to go against the tribe(those pesky mirror neurons). even though you know, myth's are just ""excuse stories"" for exploiters, to keep exploiting, who they are currently exploiting.

you just simply want to be ""associated"" with intelligent people and building dreamy utopia's. you want other peasants to see you with props(products) from the dream world that was built by your savior. you want others to think you are ""so cool and amazing"" and want them to wish they could be you.  you look for ""haters"" to justify what you're doing is the right thing. you think you are ""better"" then those who don't accept your version of reality, even though you say...everyone should be equal. 

there will never be equality. you want better and better(due to hedonic adaptation). this causes others things to be less better. this causes differences in values and the differences in value creates no equal. you either want to run an organization of people, or be the people within an organization that is being run. you look for gurus who have ""new found magical knowledge"" that no one else possess. this ""magical person"" will become your ""guru"" and he will build your ""future of dreams"". the utopia of heaven and eternal bliss...

personalities drive behaviors and the ones who are ""openness"" will be the first to go. perceptions drive emotions, emotions drive thoughts and thoughts drive actions. he who controls your perceptions, controls your actions... he who controls your stimuli, controls your perceptions. he who controls your perceptions, becomes your God! he who becomes your God... you become his peasants! and all you wanted to do was ""maximize your genetic copies into the future generations"" lmao...GOOD LUCK!

the human mind has a fatal flaw. it needs to ""discover"" reality through it's sensory system. these human senses come together to create what you refer to as reality. it's these senses that the discovery process gets exploited. exploiters will place stimuli(advertisements) in front of your path. places where you congregate(social media, etc.). the stimuli are ""hypnotic"" in nature and lure you in based off personality features and confirmation biases. the fake guru speaks like they know everything that will come before you. you believe, because others believe. how can a million people be wrong? so you go and leave, never to return with the elixir. 

your ""hero's journey"" will be nothing more then a waste of time in space. you are better off to build the ""world of the dream"" for others, then invite those ""others"" into the dream world you created(advertisements). they will fill it with their secrets and these secrets will later be used as confirmation biases, to further the ideology you created. you can become a God. you can have your peasants and that is when you will actually find your blissful utopia. passive income disguised as ""fee's"" that will keep your ideology(utopia) going forever... 

just build the ""world of the dream"", then invite the subjects into your dream world and they will buy the props that you create! build the world of the dream based off of ""personalities"". personalities are strongly linked to ""stylizations of life"". in other words: lifestyles. people want a ""lifestyle guru"" to follow. become their guru. build their dream and sell them props from the dream world you created. they will call you ""their God"" and they will become your peasants!

""the best stories"" in life win(think mythology - sky dad and earth mom). find you some screen writers to create the ""world of the dream"". then invite your future followers(through advertisements) into this dream world. market to ""personalities"" in a specific geo location at a specific demographics and social-economic status. then sell your props to those people...

you see... dreams feel real while we're in them, it's only when we wake up, that we realize, something was actually strange!",2022-02-05T02:15:18Z

Casi nada me tomó por sorpresa. De su trama solo me gustó el final porque fue un final feliz, predecible pero feliz. Las escenas de acción fueron algo sonsas y poco creibles con el nivel de disparos fallados por el enemigo, el cual estaba altamente entrenado profesionalmente. Eso si, buenos efectos especiales, escenografía, sonido, imagen y fotografía de alta gama, muy al estilo Nolan. Y por supuesto un guión muy original. En el pasado he alabado mucho a Nolan, pero esta pelíucla de verdad que me dejó con un triste sabor de boca. Al verla quería que esta terminara rápido para ver si me impreionaba con un final sorpresivo, cosa que tampoco ocurrió. Pero reconozco que a mucha gente le encantó y la alabó.

Would you watch a prequel, that's based in this universe that Nolan created, where spies try to get the technology that is used for the dreams and bring it back to whoever hired them. But in the movie they perform the very first Inception, and one of the spies who did the first Inception teaches Cobb.

Thats not what dreams are like, dreams are bizarre, illogical, crazy and surreal.

YoHD9XEInc0,@guywithbigwhitecock709,"So after reading bunch of comments for half an hour, i have come with one conclusion and I'll make it simple as i could:


  Nolan said, the ending is how you view your reality, the totem ending is his personal touch to his film to us his viewer. This is one of the way he connects with his Viewers and fans. He could just role the credit after Cobb hug his children but he pan down to the totem showing it's still spinning, now we of course here, made alot of assumptions if is it still a dream or not, the thing is. It is us to decide, the movie is literally about dream and reality, in this case nolan want us to view the ending from our own perspective. There would say it's a reality and there would say it's still a dream, honestly there is no use of arguing with everyone who has different opinion than you, because everyone's different we have our own dreams even though we live in the same reality. That was Nolan's personal touch, and for you guys out there nolan is no regular film maker, he's a god of film making, everything in his movies require second look to catch a tiny detail.
 Now the ending is just his way of kicking us, to check our own reality. The way you view the ending, say something about you. You decide it.

It is not realistic to lucid dreaming, which is something I've been very fond of for years. Also time dilation in dreams is an illusion: if you were asleep, you were dreaming for an hour but the dream cuts things out that you don't realize, making it seem much longer.

If you didn't, you wouldn't be lucid, which means clear thinking. Dreams are very realistic but I've been lucid dreaming for over four years and every lucid dream I've had I've been able to tell differences.

YoHD9XEInc0,@walterm.robertsiiiphd2157,"Am I alone in thinking this is one of the most overrated movies of recent American film-making? To my mind 70% of the dialogue is spent explaining the machinery and mechanics of shared dreaming and designing the dream-illusions -- that is to say, in unpacking and rendering plausible to the audience a deeply illogical premise. Then all of that feels like nothing more or less than a preparation for some climatic final sequence of dream manipulation. The whole thing is topped off by the entirely implausible casting of Ms. Juno as some nuclear-scientist of puzzle design. Really? It just failed to work for me at all. I remember walking out the theatre totally disappointed and then not being able to get past the midway point when I tried to watch it again on Amazon. Maybe it is just that so few people today actually have any experience of high level story-telling or fiction since no one reads classical literature anymore so now it has come to the point where the biggest money-makers are movies based on comic books or video games. Say no more.",2020-09-02T16:15:13Z

And now I need a coffee. I think my thoughts are overloaded. My philosophies in life are being affected. My perceptions about reality and simulations are being mixed up.

This movie can be related on social media and gamers today. Some people chose to just live their lives playing games and having a job for living in social media. But it depends on people. On whether they are happy about it. Because at the end of the movie you can see the totem doesn't turn around but it is almost going to be. But it's not important. What's important is Cobb was happy about his life. Which is in the case of our life, it depends on what we are happy.  Salute to overall casts and directors of this movie. This is such an art, a masterpiece. Salute from Philippines! 😌

Few days back, I was watching 1980s CBS TV Show ""Tales from the darkside"". In episode titled ""Dream Girl"", it has been shown that some people are stuck in someone else's dream. It was a very good but confusing episode, but it reminded me of this movie inception. Also that episode was written by a woman. Please watch the episode yourself to know that I am telling the truth.

“You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away.” the train is a metaphor for a journey, specifically, your life’s journey.

“You know where you hope the train will take you, but you can't be sure.” Same with life. You have your expectations of where you want your life to lead, but you can never be sure.

“Yet it doesn't matter. Now, tell me why?” As with life, even if you don’t know where your life will lead you, it doesn’t matter, because as the answer to the riddle says: “we’ll be together!”

You’ll understand this when you find someone you really love. The destination doesn’t matter as long as you’re with someone you love.",2020-06-03T02:40:08Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@RTwistzz,"@Galaxyeterna never heard of if but I know parts of the anime film Paprika served as inspiration. Imo it isn’t fair to say a director “stole a whole other movie” like this. The craft and pacing is unjust in Inception, which is something that must be credited to when attempting to say the idea/plot or script was a rip off. However I challenge you to come up with one short idea for a movie or book that’s never been done before. See? None! It’s impossible in modern day. There are only 6-8 different plots in cinema and that’s a philosophy very commonly taught in film school. Also it’s a given for director (especially auteurs like Nolan) to use inspiration of a different film, especially one not so famous, as a creative choice made by an artist in homage to honour a personal favourite of theirs and also potential to bring it more popularity. 
No originally movie is completely and wholy the same as there cannot be a ripoff so blatantly the same due to strict copyright laws in hollywood, Nolan’s film is not stolen as it features original characters and narrative. However maybe somewhat reminiscent of a pre-existing movie or several, can you tell me why you think it’s not okay for a movie as unique and superbly written snd made as this one to resemble a film from 30 odd years ago, already out there and note in mind it’s a film I’ve never even heard of, let alone what anybody else has.",2025-06-02T04:54:42Z

The collective gasp the  crowd around me gave at the last scene  when the totem was about to topple(?) and cut to black is one of the best memories I had. The high quality images, the absolutely astounding music, the fascinating plot, all way ahead- original, ingenious and did not take the audience for idiots.

Of course it's a Nolan and Zimmer movie, but I think one of the not often mentioned reason the movie so perfect is  DiCaprio. He lived that role to the bit. I was totally convinced that it was a real world and he really was an extractor. The way he enunciated words, his expressions, no one could have pulled off this role with such finesse.",2020-05-10T16:04:23Z

Of course since the time is almost being divided by 2 each time, this same 360 should have taken place in both the second and third layers. I know it was probably so meaningless to even think about putting in the movie, but it would still have viewers thinking and processing what happened and why it would make sense. Also, when everyone woke up on the plane, and seemed confused, was this because they were all having interconnected dreams after all?

Inception is share dreaming used in some spiritual practice to know about Dimensions and to understand the universe and witness the oneness

YoHD9XEInc0,@xerxesprince8773,"Inception, a movie about 'everlasting love'. Notice how 'Cob' (Leonardo Dicaprio) and his wife in the film named 'Maul' share a totem? That's symbolism of their everlasting love for one another. When in the movie 'Maul' apparently dies, 'Cob' is left with an uncompromised situation of whether his totem is dictating a false reality or a real one. You see because they both had to believe in the totem, a symbol that meant 'they both had to believe in each other and their love for one another', it meants that if one partner dies the totem becomes completey unreliable. First off, never share a totem, it inflicts the apparent necessity of each persons to believe in it to make it useful. When Maul dies, the audience couldn't possibly tell whether or not she 'made the correct decision', because the story then leads to believe she was delusional and then the story continues to move onward with Cob being 'framed for the murder of his wife'. Notice how the entire movie is about Cob trying to get back home to his children? That's because the ENTIRE movie revolves around the moment Cobs wife dies. When she died the totem became unreliable to Cob, notice how Cob controls the totem with his mind through the loss of his wife? In every sequence or scene when Cob is in a dream with Maul, the totem keeps on spinning forever, symbolism for 'love'. If  Maul really DID make the correct decision when she jumped off the ledge to kill herself inside of a dream to see her kids in what humans would call 'the real world', then Cob would be at loss in insanity to believe that his definiton of 'the real world' is the level at which he lost his wife. Do you recall the elevator scene with multiple levels? That's an indication of 'dream leveling', making simultaneous levels of dreams. If Maul is dead on that 'level' of dream in Cobs mind, then that means that's where Cob recognises that 'level' to be 'void of' or 'without' Maul. Therefore because Maul is no longer with Cob on that level of dream casting the totem proves to Cob his heart is broken because his wife has allegedly 'died' on that level, which means the totem falls over, because notice how I said the totem represents 'everlasting love'.  As I explain the ending of this movie Inception, just keep in mind that Cob was in limbo ever since his wife passed away, again notice how I said the ENTIRE movie revolves around the loss of Maul. Okay so here's the ending explained, when Cob gets back to his family in the United States, he spins the totem one more time and notices his children playing in the yard. Well he then goes off to the yard to be with his beloved kids, and because he loves his kids so much the totem keeps spinning, a symbolism of 'unconditional love'. It's only because Maul isn't there 'in Cobs mind' (on that level of dream casting), where you see a tiny flicker of the totem about to fall down just before the last cut scene. The totem represents 'everlasting love',  and because in Cob and Maul's dreams they wanted to have perfect lifes, that means the totem was perfect, meaning it would never fall down. But because Cob's heart was broken his totem proved to him an imperfect life, thus the 'spinning top falling over'. So as you see you should never share a totem it is high stakes for insanity.  Cobs totem became his demise because he shared his totem with his wife. The totem represents a perfect reality from an imperfect one and everyone is aware we don't always get perfect dreams. Cob's in limbo the entire movie, every stitch of his life since his wife died. Thank you for reading.",2018-12-09T20:39:39Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@antona.1327,"Am I the only one who sees the glaring parallels between Inception and Jacob's Ladder? I saw Jacob's Ladder fairly recently, but after giving the movie some thought, it came to me that it reminds a lot of Inception -- or Inception reminds a lot of Jacob's Ladder. They not only share a similar plot structure, but similar themes as well. Jacob's Ladder is obviously a much more gritty and cerebral film, but see for yourself:

The protagonist is unsure if the world around him is real or not? Check.

The protagonist grieves for the loss of his loved one and blames himself for it? Check.

The plot of the film revolves around a conspiracy? Check.

The plot shifts between time periods and settings to confuse the audience on what is real and what is not real? Check.

The ending is about the protagonist coming back to his past and facing the truth to be reunited with someone he loves? Check.

Since Inception was originally meant to be a horror movie, I think Mr. Nolan could've used that movie as an inspiration for the original version of the movie, which he wrote back in the early 2000s. Which I buy more than that nonsense about Nolan ""ripping off"" Paprika.",2018-11-21T07:10:45Z

Also, for those of you who are asking if Cobb is in a dream or not, the answer is no. If you watch closely at the end of the movie, you'll see the totem is about to fall itself after spinning. It just didn't show it. So Cobb is actually back into reality with his children, which makes it a happy ending.",2020-05-11T14:38:36Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@AbhishekSanyalTGV,"I have read all your replies. What I meant was, in case of Interstellar, there exist equations and derivations for calculating the time dilation, given the fraction of speed with respect to the speed of light. All Nolan had to do was to convey that to the audience using a story. A lot of people must have been amused to see that the father outlived the daughter (but it wouldn't be that amusing to those who study physics). I already knew what the climax was going to be. 
In case of Inception, no one could predict the climax. Also, the Paprika thing. You don't need to reinvent the wheel every time you decide to design a new car, right? Paprika isn't half as engaging as Inception. Don't cry like the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network. Also,  somebody mentioned 'Lucid Dreaming' exists. I know that. But the little concepts like, 'In the dream, the brain functions faster', and '5 minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream'...Nolan came up with this. Not like in Interstellar, where you have a plethora of Physics books at your disposal.
From this point, anyone who argues my comment is simply trying to be intimidating.",2019-12-29T08:00:09Z

The more you struggle to get out you the more you are likely to fail! The secret is to relax into state that you want achieve. You must replace one state by another and you do this by deliberately creating a mental vacuum which the subconscious hates and then tricking your mind into the new state.


The film 'The Shawshank  Redemption' (TSR) shows you how to get out but this can take weeks, months and even years.

Who isn't? If you haven't figured that out you missed the whole concept of the film. We live in a lucid dream, except when we're in the dream within the dream (when we sleep) which can be as real (vivid) as the waking dream or or as fake (lucid) as the normal waking day!",2019-08-20T12:34:26Z

Wake up at 5 AM . Leave your bed. If you have urge to go to washroom then GO. Stay awake for 30. seconds and  have an intention to lucid dream . Then go to sleep. 

These steps have worked for me

EDIT: I FOUND ANOTHER WAYTO GET VIVID DREAMS. YOU NEED TO BE REALLY TIRED BEOFRE GOING TO BED. DO SOME EXERCISE OR ANYTHING WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL TIRED. WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE FAINTING THEN GO TO BED.

""Can any of you tell me how to lucid dream? Or just tell me your techniques and practices? ""


I think you're a bit confused by this. I split dreams into two: lucid dreams and vivid.dreams.


Vivid dreams are where I may be doing something that you think is real but is actually a dream. They can be ordinary or exciting and even intimidating and scary. .


A lucid dream (in my opinion) is where you wake up in a dream, and you know it's a dream. As you feel all the objects around you (avoid contact with people and animals) you'll find they are as solid as your waking world.


In my experience the latter is rare. I have had one major and a couple of minor. In a lucid dream you may wake and feel unable to move your body properly for a short while. This is normal.


Techniques must be learnt over many years. The less you stimulate your senses in the waking world the more likely you are to have vivid/lucid dreams.  In effect you must operate in the mind as much as possible in the waking world, thus fooling your brain. You may even find that you incur minor injuries as your body truly believes you are doing it for real!


Remember, a vivid dream can be very ordinary. It's just you weren't aware you were dreaming until you wake up.


One trick is to avoid sleep as much as possible. Then when you become tired concentrate on want you want and keep thinking about it until the exact second you fall asleep.",2019-09-10T05:56:54Z

""that means I have vivid dreams pretty much all the time""


Yes, they are fun. But the vidiness can vary, even inside each dream. I had one recently that was straight out of 'Pandorum'. Spooky!


The vidiness depends on how convinced you are actually do it - even if it is ordinary. I've read that if you hold on to a solid object long enough (not a person or animal) you will remain in the dream until you die, or switch dreams again.",2019-10-09T16:55:31Z

There is no such thing as positive and negative emotions, there are only higher and lower levels of emotions on a scale of emotions. That's bad science. But then, this is fiction movie.

But sharply woke up with a powerful sedative hmm. Seems like from then on the rest of the movie was leo's projection leading him to what he wanted in the end which was him & his kids. The saying your waiting for a train you hope you know where the train will take you but it doesn't matter why. That interests me because it makes you think yes we will be together meaning you & your mind just ultimately the journey.

If Copp was really in the Limbus and killed himself there, he also probably didn't wake up in reality, he just moved to the previous dream level. The whole movie could be him still dreaming. And I actually don't care much for that. If he is happy, in his own reality, it's a good ending for me.

One movie that is really, really good is Snowpiercer. It is on Netflix and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. First walking into it I just expected a revolt movie (because it is about people revolting) but it has twists and turns and was actually really crazy. I love Memento and that movie is definitely on my top list as well. Whiplash is more of a drama and Nightcrawler is like a thrilling crime. I highly suggest Snowpiercer but everyone likes a different style. Good list you have their as well",2015-03-12T12:46:51Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@ananddev902,Trashed Tarantino and Nolan on Same level? Bruh... you've gotta be kidding me...! Tarantino is like 7/10 where as Nolan is 9.5/10 and scorsese is obviously 10/10,2017-08-03T01:57:44Z
YoHD9XEInc0,@GamerTrashed,"I said for different reasons. They both make mostly original films for film lovers. Pulp Fiction is a movie that can easily Rival The Dark Knight and Pulp Fiction has already stood 20+ years of time and for me that's not even his best. Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, Django, Inglourious Basterds, Jackie Brown and Hateful Eight can all  rival Nolan movies as being greats. Tarantino in his own way is certainly on Nolan's level. 

Your opinion doesn't matter anyway, I should talk to others. You put Interstellar 3rd and it's probably Nolan's worst outing. Dunkirk, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception, Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight Rises and Batman Begins are all better more cohesive movies than Interstellar. The last hour, hour 10 minutes are a complete mess.",2017-08-03T05:00:31Z

YoHD9XEInc0,@antona.1327,"​Joshua Rivers, 1. If The Dark Knight sucked, then so did every other superhero movie in existence, because The Dark Knight stands above any superhero movie in existence.

2. Comic book movies, as well as comic books themselves, are not bound to being only exclusively unrealistic or otherwise. There are no rules in the comic book medium that states that you cannot make realistic stories. That's some ignorant and idiotic sentiment, because anyone with any knowledge of the comic book medium knows that comic books originally were written as ordinary tales.  The first classified comic strip, The Yellow Kid, was a collection of stories about a kid, nothing more. The extraordinary elements begun crawling into comics from pulp fiction and literature. During the 50s, the comics became highly populated by the stories of Wild, Wild West and romance tales. Comic books and realism go and hand in hand. And that goes for the superhero comics as well, because realism is exactly what made Marvel blow up in the 60s with characters such as Spider-Man, Hulk, and Iron Man, who were extensions of real-life issues. And same goes for Batman, who had a twenty-year-lasting ongoing series, titled LotDR, that was primarily focused on telling only realistic stories, which dealt with things like drug abuse, prostitution, child abuse, and corruption.

3. So am I. I've been reading comics my whole life and I buy every month at least one issue. And I say: everything you just said would be said only by someone who doesn't read comics. Anyone with basic knowledge knows that comics don't have any barriers and they stylistically can be anything - realistic or not. So have a nice day holding this L.",2018-11-21T07:24:43Z
